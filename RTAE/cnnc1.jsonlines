Republicans also fought vigorously against the Iran nuclear deal and many oppose his efforts to normalize relations with Cuba, a move that will get a big boost when he becomes the first president to visit the island in almost 90 years this weekend. Trade deals, environmental and financial regulations are other accomplishments the President wants to protect. The fight over his Supreme Court nomination, with Senate Republicans vowing to block Merrick Garland, highlights the significance of regaining control, Obama said.\"We got to have not just a Democratic president who can continue the legacy that we built together over the last 7\u00bd years, but we've got to have a Senate that is a partner in this process,\" he told supporters in Dallas last weekend. \"And I can list a whole bunch of reasons for why that's so important. It turns out that because of the untimely death of Justice Scalia -- and obviously we grieve for his family -- but the behavior of the Senate since then, I think, gives you a pretty good reason of why we think the Senate is so important.\"Whomever the Democratic nominee is, they will need the backing of the broad coalition of young voters, blacks, Hispanics and women that then-Sen. Obama brought out in 2008. Democrats are banking on Obama's popularity: He has long polled well within his own party, and a recent Gallup Poll shows his approval rating nationwide has ticked up to 50%, far higher than his predecessor George W. Bush (32%) at the same time in his presidency. In fact, while Bush endorsed Arizona Sen. John McCain in 2008, he did no campaign rallies that year, according to longtime CBS White House Correspondent Mark Knoller, who keeps extensive records of presidential activities from golf outings to stump speeches.The enthusiasm gapThe move to use Obama frequently on the stump comes as data from the states that have held primaries and caucuses so far indicate a huge enthusiasm gap. Democratic turnout has fallen in several key states compared to 2008 -- from low single digits in Illinois (2%) and Florida (3%) to even more troubling double-digit heights in Missouri (24%), North Carolina (30%) and Ohio (49%). Meanwhile, Republican voter turnout has jumped double digits in each of those states, rising some 75% in the must-win state of Ohio.Obama is already working to boost enthusiasm among Democrats, calling on them to \"get to work\" alongside him to ensure victory in November.\"I'm absolutely convinced that we will have a Democratic successor as president,\" the President said at a DNC fundraiser in Austin, Texas, last week. \"I believe we will take back the United States Senate. I think we will make real progress with respect to the House. But it depends on people feeling as if that can happen, and being engaged and working just as hard and just as full of hope as they did in 2008. And that's going to depend on me, but it's also going to depend on you. It's going to depend on each of us.\" Vice President Joe Biden will also stump for the Democratic nominee in states where he can be helpful, reprising the role he played in 2008 when he was dispatched to help woo white working-class voters in states like Pennsylvania, and he hopes to help Democrats retake the Senate, too, planning to attend events in Ohio and Washington state next week, according to his aides.The President has already been vocal about the tone of the presidential race so far, particularly on the Republican side, touting the need for inclusiveness rather than divisiveness in politics.\"The longer that we allow the political rhetoric of late to continue and the longer that we tacitly accept it, we create a permission structure that allows the animosity in one corner of our politics to infect our broader society,\" he said on Capitol Hill this week. \"And animosity breeds animosity.\"And while Trump gets much of the attention, Obama has not limited his criticism to the bombastic billionaire, blasting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz for saying he would carpet-bomb ISIS.READ: Is the GOP's stop Trump campaign too late?The President and first lady Michelle Obama voted absentee in the Illinois primary, but the White House declined to say for whom they cast their ballots. But officials have weighed in on a report in The New York Times that said the President privately told donors it was nearing the time when Bernie Sanders' campaign would end and that the party must soon come together behind Hillary Clinton -- a line seen as him putting his finger on the scale for Clinton. Press Secretary Josh Earnest vehemently denied the report.\"I was there for the fundraiser and I was there for the part where this conversation occurred,\" Earnest said Thursday. \"What I'll just say in general is that President Obama made a case that would be familiar to all of you, which is that as Democrats move through this competitive primary process, we need to be mindful of the fact that our success in November in electing a Democratic president will depend on the commitment and ability of the Democratic Party to come together behind our nominee. And the President did not indicate or specify a preference in the race.\"\"In fact,\" Earnest continued, \"the President pointed out something that he's pointed out to all of you, which is that both of the Democrats who are running, because they have demonstrated an understanding and a commitment to building on the progress that we've made thus far, would be far better presidents than anybody that's been put up on the Republican side.\"", "article_highlights": "Obama is vowing to do all he can to make sure a Democrat replaces him at 1600 Pennsylvania AvenueSo far, he has headlined 35 fundraisers since the 2014 midterm elections and he has already endorsed 10 candidates at the state level", "article_author": "Athena Jones, CNN"}

He estimated that almost all of those individuals will be at AIPAC.AIPAC is a pro-Israel lobbying group focused on energizing Americans around strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship and encouraging members of Congress to support its agenda. The annual conference is a key stop for politicians seeking an audience with the influential group and is the largest pro-Israel policy gathering of the year.An AIPAC spokesman wouldn't comment on the planned protest, but said the group has a \"longstanding policy\" to invite all the active presidential candidates to its conference during election years as an opportunity to hear from them on the U.S.-Israel relationship.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Other groups have also spoken out against Trump's attendance at AIPAC, though they haven't officially announced plans to protest.The Union for Reform Judaism, representing the largest Jewish denomination in America, put out a statement slamming Trump. \"At every turn, Mr. Trump has chosen to take the low road, sowing seeds of hatred and division in our body politic,\" said the URJ while noting that it doesn't endorse candidates.The American Jewish Committee, another large Jewish organization, put out a statement condemning \"presidential campaign violence,\" though it did not specifically name Trump.\"We do not draw analogies to the rise of communism and fascism lightly, but both of those tyrannical movements rose to power replacing democratically elected governments, by virtue of threats of, or actual, violence against their opponents,\" the AJC said. Come Together Against Hate's plan is to either skip the speech altogether or silently walk out after Trump is introduced, then assemble outside and study Jewish scripture about what Paskin called the \"opposite\" of Trump -- love and decency. \"We're hoping thousands of people will join us in that protest,\" Paskin said. \"We're going to be providing the antidote, we believe, to what Donald Trump is espousing.\"RELATED: Is the GOP's stop Trump campaign too late?Paskin said he has reached out to another rabbi, Jeffrey Salkin of Hollywood, Florida, who is planning a similar protest. Salkin confirmed to CNN that he's organizing a boycott of Trump's speech and calling for rabbis to simply be absent from the room. He said that while he wants to show that AIPAC is bipartisan and welcomes politicians of both parties, that having Trump speak does not mean the group condones his message. Citing in part Trump's statements on immigrants, women and refugees, another Israel advocacy group, J Street, put out a statement Thursday declaring that \"these factors in our view render Donald Trump unfit to be President of the United States.\"The statement added, \"Trump and his campaign, driven by racism and hate, are beyond the bounds of acceptability for the vast majority of Jewish Americans.\"Trump has been a lightning rod of criticism throughout his campaign for comments he's made and policies he's espoused, including calling for a temporary ban on all foreign Muslims entering the U.S. and blocking Syrian refugees. He's also had a tense relationship with the American Jewish community at times, delivering an awkward address in the fall to the Republican Jewish Coalition and holding positions that have rankled the pro-Israel crowd, such as refusing to pledge that Israel will keep Jerusalem as its undivided capital.Trump's daughter, Ivanka, is married to a devout Jewish man and observes Jewish customs, which Trump has mentioned on the trail.Some protesters at his events have begun wearing yellow Stars of David, a reference to the labels forced upon Jews in Nazi Germany leading up to the Holocaust.", "article_highlights": "Many participants plan to either skip the speech altogether or silently walk out after Trump is introduced", "article_author": "Tal Kopan, CNN"}

Both Cruz, who is Southern Baptist, and former 2016 candidate Ben Carson, who is Seventh-Day Adventist, have had to reaffirm the particulars of their faith after being questioned by Trump.And the criticism is particularly harsh for Romney, who has been reluctant to share his Mormon faith in public life. Some Christians do not see Mormonism as a true Christian church.Protesters try to breach entranceAs Trump was speaking, tensions between Trump supporters and protesters escalated outside the venue. One Trump protester grabbed the hat of a supporter and threw it, and earlier, a Trump supporter shoved a protester who was speaking into a megaphone. As this was happening, dozens of police officers looked on.Opinion: The cause of violence at Trump rallies?At one point, protesters attempted to breach the entrance at the Infinity Event Center as Secret Service officers quickly shut the doors. The protesters were shouting \"To the doors,\" \"Chicago\" and \"Shut it down\" before the doors were abruptly closed.More than 40 police officers in riot gear moved in, creating a standoff between authorities and scores of protesters at the entrance.The incident, which took place as Trump's event was winding down, caused security inside the venue to direct attendees to leave through a side entrance after the GOP front-runner concluded his remarks. Outside, attendees were directed down a path away from the demonstrations but many from the rally walked over to the protesters and engaged in tense conversations and shouting matches.Protesters gather outside the Infinity Event Center where Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump was to speak at a campaign rally in Salt Lake City, Utah.Salt Like City police said on Twitter shortly after 9 p.m. local time that no arrests had been made. Det. Cody Lougy told CNN that a \"couple hundred\" protesters were present out of a crowd of about 500 to 600 people, many of whom were there to support Trump.But the unrest didn't affect Trump's rally -- which was notable for a lack of protesters inside the center, unlike typical Trump events -- as he mentioned the demonstrators in his speech as part of an observation he made about the \"love\" in the room.\"There's even some love for the protesters,\" Trump said to boos. \"Honestly, they're doing their thing.\"Later Friday, Trump went on Twitter to praise the \"fantastic crowd\" inside the event.

A banner also will be flown over the office Sen. Chuck Grassley, the Republican chairman of the Judiciary Committee who incensed Democrats by refusing to schedule a hearing for the judge. His decision brought a wave of negative press back home for the popular and independent-minded Grassley, who is seeking a seventh term this year in Iowa. Asked by CNN if his tough position on filling the vacancy was hurting his standing in Iowa, Grassley responded, \"You can't worry about that. You've got to do what's right.\" With Republican leaders dug in, Democrats are hoping rank-and-file GOP senators will be persuaded to change course by constituents who are fed up with dysfunction and gridlock in Washington and who will view the decision not to act on Garland as more of the unacceptable same. Illinois Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, who is up for re-election this year, told WLS radio in Chicago on Friday that the Senate should \"man up\" and hold a vote on Garland.But right now most Republicans, even those facing voters in November, aren't budging. \"I continue to believe the Senate should not move forward with the confirmation process until the people have spoken by electing a new president,\" said Sen.

And it should stay that way,\" said a President who once called out the justices in person over the Citizens United ruling on campaign finance during a State of the Union address.\"To suggest that someone as qualified and respected as Merrick Garland doesn't even deserve a hearing, let alone an up-or-down vote, to join an institution as important as our Supreme Court,\" Obama said, \"that would be unprecedented.\"Calling the Senate's bluffObama has admitted that he has sometimes fallen short on the theatrics of the presidency.But he did not shirk on the stage management Tuesday, as he shepherded Garland into the spring-filled beauty of the White House Rose Garden, the venue for many symbolic and ceremonial presidential moments over the decades.The President's appearance validated one of the great truths of Washington -- that when someone professes to be above the grubby political impulses of his rivals, he's usually playing the game at a more sophisticated level himself.In essence, Obama was signaling to the GOP that whatever political price there is to pay for their refusal to consider his pick, the bill is now due.RELATED: Dem, GOP 2016ers split on Obama Supreme Court pick\"In this sense, then, the President is calling the Republican Senate's bluff,\" said Professor Thomas Keck, an expert on the Supreme Court and U.S. politics at Syracuse University.\"If the Senate's leaders stick to their pledge not to consider or even meet with any Obama nominee, it will be clear that they are doing so solely for partisan reasons and not due to any concerns with the nominee's qualifications or record.\"There was also another implicit political message for Republicans to digest. Obama could have chosen a more liberal, Democratic-base-pleasing nominee in election year, but didn't, disappointing some on the left of his party.In the context of a campaign that could produce a mandate for a Democratic successor, Hillary Clinton, who has been dragged left by her own party, he seemed to be saying to Republican senators: take what I am offering or you may rue the day.\"President Obama is saying to the Senate Republicans, you can take my 63-year-old now or wait for President Hillary Clinton to bring up a 45-year-old in 10 months,\" said CNN Senior Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin.Garland, the man for the time and placeIn many ways, Garland is a case of cometh the political hour, cometh the man. He has been passed over for previous spots on the court as apparently insufficiently 'historic' or youthful, as Obama picked the first Hispanic on the bench in Sonia Sotomayor and then Elena Kagan, who could have decades left to exert his progressive legal outlook.But the spectacularly conventional nature of Garland's resume \u2014 from Harvard Law to distinguished and unblemished service in the Justice Department to the top appeals court in the land -- that worked against him before suddenly became an asset.So while Sotomayor satisfied his impulse to make history, his later picks of Kagan, his former solicitor general, and especially Garland show a streak of pragmatism often evident during his presidency.A President hoping to make Republicans look bad for blocking his appointment could hardly have found anyone so objectively qualified to serve.It didn't hurt either that Garland had previously been confirmed by several sitting Republican senators when he was nominated by President Bill Clinton, who the senators spoke of him in glowing terms.The picture of unquestioned merit was solidified when Garland took to the microphone in the Rose Garden. His voice cracked as he spoke of the \"gift\" of his nomination and his love for his family, his nation and the Constitution, coming across as the modest and personable antithesis of the scheming, agenda-driven vortex into which he had just stepped.And now, the Senate battleContrasting with Obama's theatrics, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, in his unspectacular style, put on a show of quiet defiance to stiffen the spine of his troops in swing state re-election contests who may not relish the fight ahead.JUST WATCHEDSCOTUS Nominations: A look at Senator responses over the yearsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSCOTUS Nominations: A look at Senator responses over the years 01:13\"It is a president's constitutional right to nominate a Supreme Court justice and it is the Senate's constitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its consent,\" McConnell said in his flat monotone, like a lawyer stating the facts of a case.And McConnell, speaking from the Senate floor, showed the President that two can play the political game, reviving an old quote from Vice President Joe Biden.\"'It would be our pragmatic conclusion that once the political season is under way, and it is, action on a Supreme Court nomination must be put off until after the election campaign is over,'\" McConnell quoted his old Senate sparring partner saying in 1992.Republicans trawling for White House hypocrisy might have also taken exception to Obama's Rose Garden announcement itself -- since Biden -- a key player in obstructionist Supreme Court confirmation fights in the past, including his orchestration of the rejection of President Ronald Reagan pick Judge Robert Bork -- stood alongside the President as he made his speech.In some ways, Garland's nomination is a poisoned chalice: it is highly likely that he won't get a hearing and his chances of claiming late Justice Antonin Scalia's seat are questionable at best. There is no guarantee, for instance, that Hillary Clinton, if elected president, would renew his nomination, given pressure on her to demonstrate early progressive credentials by appointing a more clear-cut liberal.RELATED: Senate GOP: No hearings for Supreme Court nomineeThat was why Garland's comments about his nomination being \"the greatest honor\" of his life other than his marriage and the \"greatest gift\" other than the birth of his daughters were so striking.They seemed to hint that even if he does not make it to the bench, Garland may view the fact that he was chosen at all as no small honor. Or he could be a man for whom the prize of the high court is so great that it is worth braving the political fire to come.If Garland's nomination does fail, he can go back to his job as top judge of America's second-most prestigious bench -- the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.Thus, Obama will not have torched a less established judicial career, or burned a potential Supreme Court nominee likely to excite liberal ideologues, like Garland's colleague Sri Srinivasan, who a future Democratic president may wish to put forward.And while Washington seems resigned to a stalemate in which Garland is left in unconfirmable limbo, the White House may still hope that things could change.Should November's election produces a President Clinton -- or even the upredictable ideological prospect of a President Trump -- some GOP senators could be tempted to cut their losses in a lame duck session of Congress and settle for the judge they know.", "article_highlights": "Obama nominated Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court WednesdayHis selection demonstrates cold-eyed calculation and represents a clear case of Obama calling the Republicans' bluffIn some ways, however, Garland's nomination is a poisoned chalice", "article_author": "Stephen Collinson, CNN"}

Federal data does not break down those applications by race, but grass-roots organizations, like the Florida Immigrant Coalition, say their naturalization drives across their swing state are filled primarily by Latinos. \"They feel very unsafe with his words,\" said Florida Immigrant Coalition spokesman Ivan Parra. \"They want to be respected. For them, it is an emergency.\" Parra was one of the lawyers weaving through people from table to table in a donated space at a mall in Lauderhill, Florida. The event opened at 10 a.m., but the line had begun to form at 5 a.m., said Broward County Commissioner Dale Holness. At least 50 people showed up without appointments, hoping to begin filing paperwork. Latinos see Trump as hurting GOP brandHolness said in the 40 years he's lived in Florida, he's never seen this many residents filing for citizenship. Naturalization advocates say applications typically spike in election years, but this year has been extraordinary. \"Trump's tone is getting people scared. Though he's often saying 'illegal,' the legal people who've been here don't feel secure either. They could be next. So for one, they want to protect themselves so they don't get thrown out for any reason. Two, they want to make sure they're engaged to the extent that they can contribute to insuring that Trump's not the person,\" he said.Grass-roots groups point to the enormous population that for many years didn't pursue citizenship, often citing the $680 fee as a factor.

The opportunity presented by Trump's candidacy seems to have trumped that once-prohibitive cost to apply, said Catholic Legal Services' Raul Hernandez.\"If that is the motivation for them to become citizens, I welcome the motivation,\" said Hernandez. He adds that if all those residents become naturalized, \"it's a game changer.\" \"It's going to be a totally different political situation -- folks with a different view of what a citizen is, raising their voice, saying, 'I'm here and I want to have a say in the future of the nation,'\" he said.JUST WATCHEDNew poll: 3 out of 4 Hispanics 'don't like Trump'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNew poll: 3 out of 4 Hispanics 'don't like Trump' 01:58Data from the University of Southern California Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration shows in the United States, 4.5 million Latinos are eligible for naturalization.

She also anchors with Jorge Ramos, famously tossed out of a Trump news conference when he attempted to confront Trump on his immigration proposals and refused to sit down.

What if no one clinches the nomination and the GOP descends on Cleveland in July with multiple candidates still vying for the party crown?Here's a look at what would need to happen over the coming months to create that wild scenario, and a few of the ways it could play out on the floors and backrooms of the Quicken Loans arena (which, we should note, does not allow smoking anywhere on site.)How do we get there?The Republican party will assign 2,472 delegates through a state-by-state series of caucuses and primaries between February and June. To win the nomination, a given candidate requires a simple majority, or 1,237, of the total. The states holding their contests before March 15 are required by party rules to dole out their delegates proportionately, meaning 51% of the vote translates to the same percentage of the state's allotted delegates. To further complicate the matter, there is the party's so-called \"Rule 40.\" This bylaw, added in 2012, states that any potential nominee must \"demonstrate the support of a majority of the delegates from each of eight or more states.\" There are, as we approach the CNN debate in Las Vegas on Tuesday, a total of 14 candidates in the mix. No fewer than 10 can reasonably expect to win a noteworthy proportion of delegates as the race extends into spring. For example, polls have shown Trump with a durable lead in Iowa -- he's up 13 points on Ted Cruz, his closest rival, according to Monday's CNN/ORC poll -- but even then, his total support in this sprawling field is only 33%. Multiple candidates could win a majority in eight or more states, or no one could. Either way, it adds up to chaos on the convention floor. (Interestingly, the rule essentially prevents a would-be outside savior, like Mitt Romney, from parachuting into the process late, as that person would obviously arrive without those eight state majorities.)One Republican with a full grasp of the RNC rules reached out after the story first published to point out that the eight-state requirement in Rule 40 is technically temporary. The RNC will vote on a new rule at the convention in 2016 and could again change the number of states at that time.\"Contested\" or \"Brokered\" -- What's the difference?Simply stated, if no candidate (and this goes for both parties) finishes the primary season with majority of delegates, the summer convention can be described as \"contested.\" The last \"contested\" GOP primary came in 1976, when President Gerald Ford and an insurgent conservative named Ronald Reagan arrived at Kansas City's Kemper Arena short of a clinching total. Both campaigns sought to sway or romance their way to the necessary majority, which Ford would seal just before the first floor vote.American president Gerald Ford (left) listens as future American president Ronald Reagan (1911 - 2004) delivers a speech during the closing session of the Republican National Convention on August 19, 1976 in Kansas City, Missouri.Because that initial ballot delivered Ford the nomination, the 1976 convention is not technically considered to have been \"brokered.\" For that, we have to look back more than 60 years, to the 1952 Democratic contest. Tennessee Senator Estes Kefauver led the race after the last round of primary voting, but did not win the nomination after the first floor ballot. No one did.

Opinion: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are made for each otherClinton's victory in Ohio on Tuesday was particularly sweet, coming one week after she suffered an unexpected loss in Michigan.Her narrow defeat there raised questions about whether the candidate had pivoted too soon to the general election and neglected to campaign as aggressively as possible for primary victories, sparking fresh concerns about more unanticipated losses. That defeat may ultimately turn out to be an anomaly given her wins in Ohio and Illinois.On the other side of the political aisle, Trump also had a good night.Six hours of Super Tuesday #3 on CNN in 2 minutesThe New York billionaire won the Florida GOP primary, defeating Marco Rubio in his home state and forcing the Florida senator to drop his White House campaign.

Ford defeated Reagan in 1976 by similar means.But if no one emerges with the magic number after that first ballot, the real action begins. The states and territories are governed by slightly differing rules, but most require their bound delegates -- the ones awarded during the primaries and caucuses -- to vote according to those results for only one round. If there's no winner, more than half of the delegates immediately become free agents. This is when the convention moves into its \"brokered\" phase and the campaigns begin to vigorously compete for their support on a second ballot. Some states require their delegates to remain pledged through multiple rounds. California, for instance, only releases its bounty of 172 delegates before the third vote.2) Is there anyway of knowing how the delegates will vote after they are unboundNot really.In Arkansas, for instance, we know that Donald Trump won 16 pledged delegates to Ted Cruz's 15 and Marco Rubio's 9. But there will be another vote, at a statewide gathering late April, to decide who will be the individuals charged with delivering those votes at the national convention.Tom Lundstrum is one of the hopefuls. A former state GOP rules chairman, he is running to be one of Cruz's delegates in Cleveland.But what would Lundstrum do in the event Kasich and Trump were the only two viable candidates, and Cruz was out of the game?\"If I'm elected to go to the convention, I will represent Ted Cruz on behalf of the people of Arkansas who voted for him. And if I am a Cruz delegate, I will not change my ballot until I'm told by Ted Cruz that he's releasing his delegates, if it comes to that,\" he told CNN on Tuesday.\"I don't know at this point what would induce me to vote for (Trump) or (Kasich) -- if that's who it comes down to, I would have to give some serious consideration to the fact that Donald Trump won the plurality of Arkansas delegates,\" he continued. \"And so I'm thinking on the behalf of my state -- I'm there to represent them, not myself -- I think I'd be inclined to always... If I'm going to make an error it's going to be on the side of the voters of Arkansas.\" Now imagine a couple hundred people with similarly conflicted feelings and loyalties.3) What is the \"Rules Committee\" and what kind of power do they have?The party's \"Rules Committee\" is as powerful as it is difficult to handicap. In the end, it will comprise 112 members, with two representatives -- one man, one woman -- from each of the 56 states and territories sending delegates to the convention.Further complicating matters, many of the states, even those that have already allotted delegates mathematically, have not yet elected the individuals who will make up the numbers. \"Part of the confusion is that we don't even know yet who most of these people are going to be,\" said Richard E. Berg-Andersson, researcher and historian for The Green Papers blog, a long-running authority on the nominating process. \"Most of the states haven't held the district or state conventions that will actually name the warm bodies sitting in the seats. They don't even know who from Iowa will be eligible from Iowa to be on the rules committee.\"4) What is \"Rule 40\" and does it apply in 2016?In past years, the process had mostly been an afterthought. But the pre-convention meeting in 2012 was more contentious than usual, as loyalists to Mitt Romney led a successful push to change a number of rules. Among them: a requirement that candidates win a majority of the delegates in at least eight states in order to be considered viable at the convention.Right now, only Donald Trump meets that standard.But -- as Republicans versed in the rules will tell you, the eight-state requirement in Rule 40 is technically temporary. The RNC could vote on a new rule at the convention in 2016 and might again change the number of states at that time.It would have to be changed if party grandees wanted to make way for a late-entering longshot challenger -- like, say, Mitt Romney.5) Which states will have the most power going into a contested convention?Influence at a contested convention has less to do with delegate count or size than by-laws and procedure. For that reason, keep an eye on Pennsylvania.In a state with 71 total delegates, only 17 will enter the convention pledged to a candidate. The other 54 will effectively be up for grabs, regardless of the outcome of the state's April 26 primary. North Dakota and the some of the territories have similar systems.Colorado and Wyoming are two more states likely to get some attention. Though Ted Cruz won 9 of the 12 delegates on offer at Wyoming's county convention, there will be another 14 available during a state convention on April 16. Colorado will directly elect 34 delegates a week earlier. These typically quiet competitions, with a small number of voters to convince, will take on added importance if the race stays tight.6) What happens to delegates assigned to candidates who drop out of the race \u2014 do they become free agents right away?This question is decided on a state-by-state basis. \"There are three basic flavors to the release process,\" explains Josh Putnam, a political scientist and founder of Frontloading HQ. \"On one end of the spectrum you've got delegates who are locked in regardless of how many ballots it goes, states like Iowa. On the other end of spectrum you've got states like New Hampshire and Michigan that, once a candidate's out, their delegates are automatically released and unbound.\"The third category is the most intriguing. In a number of states, delegates are reallocated automatically based in part on the results of the original primary or caucus vote. Kentucky, Putnam notes, is a good example. The state voted on March 5, with Marco Rubio winning 7 delegates. With the Florida senator now leaving the race, his 7 delegates are likely to become uncommitted, then bound again by the Kentucky delegation.7) Trump has said he should be the nominee if he has a plurality of the vote \u2014 could that be enough?The requirement that a candidate win the 1,237 nominating majority, the bedrock rule of the primary process, is almost certainly off the table. \"It's a marathon, and if you run a marathon, even if all the other runners collapse before the 25-mile mark, if you collapse at the 26-mile-mark, you haven't crossed the finish line,\" is how Berg-Andersson explained the GOP's thinking. \"So the finish line here is 1,237 delegates. Sorry, that's the rule.\"Putnam agreed -- a plurality simply won't do it.\"I doubt any change is in the offing,\" he said. \"I don't think they would either lower that or raise it in an effort to prevent Trump. That sort of proposal has never really come up.\"", "article_highlights": "John Kasich's Ohio victory increases the probability of a GOP deadlockThere hasn't been a 'brokered' Republican convention since 1948", "article_author": "Gregory Krieg, CNN"}

His campaign slogan was \"a new American century\" -- as he tried to send the message that America needed a new generation of leadership that could deal with the challenges ahead. It was also a way to spin his relative youth, and short time in the U.S. Senate as an advantage.He drew heavily from his life story on the trail. The child of Cuban immigrants, Rubio's parents worked menial jobs like bartending and hotel cleaning to provide for their children. His stump speech drove home the message that Americans should leave their children better off than they were, and warned that dream was slipping away.After not winning any of the early contests, Rubio's advisers and donors banked on him consolidating the establishment vote -- particularly after Jeb Bush quit the race -- and winning in big states like his home of Florida.Meanwhile, Trump continued to lead the pack and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz became the second favorite, picking up the first contest of Iowa and far more states than Rubio along the way. Rubio tried several tactics to deal with Trump. At first, he mostly ignored the front-runner, aiming his fire instead for his closest competitors for the nomination like Cruz and Bush. But as Trump continued to roll, Rubio made a sudden strategy change at the GOP debate in late February in Houston. That night and in successive days, Rubio unleashed a torrent of opposition research combined with schoolyard insults, suddenly mentioning Trump by name and hand size in his stump speeches. Trump responded in kind, making a crude joke about his penis size at a following debate, and seemed to get the better of the tiff against \"Little Rubio,\" who lost momentum rather than gain it after the attacks. Rubio's other major stumble came much earlier in the campaign, in the first primary on the calendar. At the New Hampshire debate before the Granite State's contest, Rubio fell into his habit of repeating his one-liners, and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie mocked him brutally for doing so. The widely panned debate performance was followed by a dismal fifth place finish in that early primary, only made worse by establishment rival Ohio Gov. John Kasich's surprise second place placement.The Cuban-American did get his mojo back, though, nabbing the highly sought-after endorsement of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to best Cruz for second in that state and Nevada. And after Bush's departure from the race, a slew of establishment Republicans ran to endorse Rubio, including Haley being joined by the sitting governors of Kansas, Arkansas, Tennessee and New Mexico. Rubio lost every one of those states, except New Mexico, which has yet to vote. The campaign has blamed other candidates for some of their troubles, including singling out Kasich as a spoiler. Kasich's share of the vote especially stung in Virginia on Super Tuesday, where Rubio came within 3 percentage points of beating Trump. But despite his campaign's argument that an establishment candidate could win if the slate of candidates would just narrow, anti-establishment candidates Trump and Cruz only picked up steam in the wake of Rubio's endorsement avalanche, as Rubio fell back to third and fourth place in races. His last stand came down to his home state of Florida, which was called for Trump as soon as polls closed at 8 p.m.", "article_highlights": "Marco Rubio dropped out of the presidential race after losing the primary in his home state of FloridaRubio struggled to win states against Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and banked his campaign future on winning Florida", "article_author": "Tal Kopan, CNN"}

Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a vulnerable incumbent, said in an email to CNN.And in a statement, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a New Hampshire Republican facing a competitive reelection fight in 2016, said the Senate should not confirm a Supreme Court nominee until a new president is elected.\"We're in the midst of a consequential presidential election year, and Americans deserve an opportunity to weigh in given the significant implications this nomination could have for the Supreme Court and our country for decades to come,\" Ayotte said. \"I believe the Senate should not move forward with the confirmation process until the American people have spoken by electing a new president.\"Political calculationThe political calculation underscores the high-stakes nature of the 2016 campaign. The race for control of the Senate -- and the future of the Supreme Court -- is playing out against the backdrop of an already tumultuous presidential race. With 24 GOP Senate seats at play compared to 10 for the Democrats, both sides are already calculating how the Supreme Court vacancy could upend the high-stakes battle for the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a 54-46 majority.Democrats believe McConnell must feel his grip on the Senate majority is at risk to let Obama's nominee come forward. On Sunday, Sen. Chuck Schumer, the likely next Democratic leader, foreshadowed the Democratic attack line.\"The American people don't like obstruction,\" Schumer, a New York Democrat, said on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"When you go right off the bat and say, 'I don't care who he nominates, I am going to oppose him,' that's not going to fly.\"Schumer added: \"I believe that many of the mainstream Republicans, when the president nominates a mainstream nominee, will not want to follow Mitch McConnell over the cliff.\"Schumer and his aides declined to comment further, but other Democratic senators and aides believe the pressure will be unsustainable, especially if the Supreme Court reaches a spate of 4-4 rulings and Obama chooses a qualified nominee widely viewed in the mainstream of judicial thought. Since 1975, no nominee has waited for a confirmation vote longer than 108 days from the time he or she was selected. \"If the Republican leadership refuses to even hold a hearing, I think that is going to guarantee they're going to lose control of the Senate,\" Vermont Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Shortly after news of Scalia's death, McConnell issued a statement eulogizing the conservative justice -- and sent a warning to the president.\"The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,\" McConnell said. \"Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president.\"Moments later, Obama promised that he would still choose someone to replace Scalia, but it remains uncertain who the president will nominate or when the nomination might be announced.McConnell's statement stopped short of saying that he would prevent a confirmation vote from even occurring. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said the GOP leader \"would have more to say\" when the president submits his pick. Two sources close to the GOP leader do not believe that McConnell would allow a vote under any circumstances, arguing that the Republicans will be able to push back against political pressure from the left by saying that the choice should be left to voters -- not members of Congress -- and that a Supreme Court confirmation fight in the president's final year in office typically does not happen. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, made a similar statement, saying that \"it only makes sense that we defer to the American people who will elect a new president to select the next Supreme Court justice.\"Beth Levine, a Grassley spokeswoman, declined to comment beyond the statement, which did not address whether the Senate Judiciary Committee would have a hearing on the next nominee.Vulnerable Republicans stay mumWhether vulnerable Republicans will change that dynamic remains to be seen. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who is in a tough Senate race, issued a statement Saturday praising Scalia's tenure on the court, but didn't address whether he opposes any nominee coming for a vote. He issued another statement Monday backing McConnell's strategy.Toomey of Pennsylvania made similar remarks, and a spokesman declined to comment Sunday. A spokeswoman for Kirk, the Illinois Republican, didn't respond to an inquiry seeking comment.READ: Justice Antonin Scalia's death quickly sparks political battleNo matter what happens in the Senate races, however, it would require a widely acceptable Supreme Court nominee in order for Obama to win confirmation. That's because he'll need at least 14 Republicans to break ranks and overcome an almost-certain filibuster, which Ted Cruz promised Sunday to wage. \"Absolutely,\" Cruz said when asked on ABC's \"This Week\" if he would filibuster any nominee. \"This should be a decision for the people.\"The matter is causing a clear partisan split.

Some supporters pointed to the fact that, in contrast to Sanders, Clinton had only campaigned in Detroit, Flint and Grand Rapids. After campaigning tirelessly in Nevada and South Carolina, Clinton's schedule in Michigan seemed less packed.Hand-wringingThe hand-wringing inside the Clinton circle also included the concern that perhaps the campaign had lost sight of winning the Democratic nomination \u2014 and started looking ahead at the general election too soon. \"They didn't take Sanders for granted as much as voters,\" said one top Democrat close to the campaign.Clinton told supporters on Monday that \"the sooner I could become your nominee, the more I could begin to turn my attention to the Republicans.\"Clinton's aides seemed to anticipate the potential of a Michigan loss. A memo last week from Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook noted \"even if Sen. Sanders were able to eke out a victory (in Michigan), we would still net more delegates in Mississippi, which holds its election on the same night.\"Indeed, Clinton actually won more delegates than Sanders on Tuesday, according to a CNN estimate, picking up 84 to Sanders' 67. She now has 1,234 of the 2,383 delegates needed to win the nomination. That figure includes super delegates, party officials and office holders who have said they will back her.Sanders has 567 delegates overall.As it began to dawn on the Clinton campaign that the Michigan contest would be much tighter than it had anticipated, Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton's communication director, said that demographics were partly to blame. \"Michigan looks a lot like states that Sen. Sanders does well in. The Democratic vote is only about 75% white -- that is always coming in at a disadvantage to us,\" Palmieri told reporters Tuesday night in Ohio.

But on Tuesday night, Palmieri denied that the tightness in Michigan indicates potential problems for Clinton in Ohio, arguing that Clinton's message on jobs, the auto bailout and the Republican Party can deliver them the Buckeye State.\"We think that she came into Michigan with a very strong economic agenda and message about how she would create jobs and put manufacturing sector around clean energy, also how she would help create small businesses, very future-oriented,\" Palmieri said. \"We don't think Senator Sanders offered that and we think that that will be effective in Ohio.\"Sanders acknowledged that the Michigan vote was close but thanked voters for \"repudiating\" polls that indicated Clinton had stronger support in the state.\"What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people's revolution that we're talking about, the political revolution that we're talking about, is strong in every part of the country,\" Sanders said. \"And, frankly, we believe our strongest areas are yet to happen.\"", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "MJ Lee, Jeff Zeleny, Dana Bash and Dan Merica, CNN"}

A \"caucus\" is very different. It's a neighborhood event that requires several hours of active communal participation and debate, and takes place in the evening in a home or public space, depending on the size of the caucus location.

We usually know who the party nominees will be by late spring, but they are not officially chosen until the national party convention in the summer.Does the nominee with the most votes win?If only!Instead of selecting a president based on how many votes they receive, the Founding Fathers established what's called the Electoral College. Each state gets the same number of electors as it has Congressmen and Senators -- and the bigger the state, the more electors it has.In all but two states (Maine and Nebraska), it's a winner-take-all system -- so if you win 60% of the vote in California, you get all of that state's electors.

She will now look to big state contests next Tuesday in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Illinois to restore her momentum.Sanders acknowledged that the Michigan vote was close, but thanked voters for \"repudiating\" polls that indicated Clinton had stronger support in the state.\"What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people's revolution that we're talking about, the political revolution that we're talking about, is strong in every part of the country,\" Sanders said. \"And, frankly, we believe our strongest areas are yet to happen.\"Even the Sanders camp appeared to be surprised by the victory, as the candidate held a rally for supporters in Florida hours before his victory was confirmed.\"We didn't know at the end whether we were going to get over the hump or not,\" Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN. He predicted that with most Southern states now out of the way, the calendar was turning in favor of the senator.The Clinton campaign put a brave face on the defeat, by about two percent of the vote, after earlier warning that the race was much closer than polls that gave Clinton a big lead suggested.Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said their strategy \"is built around accruing delegates and we will come out on top on delegates.\"Even though she lost Michigan to Sanders, Clinton actually won more delegates on the night, according to a CNN estimate, picking up 84 to Sanders' 67.

Cruz was in second place at 24.9% and Ohio Gov. John Kasich was at 24.3%. With 95% of the Mississippi vote in, Trump was in first at 47.3% followed by Cruz at 36.3% and Kasich at 8.8%.The Michigan results could provide a lift to Kasich if he has a second-place finish, or is a close third. That performance is a good omen for his must-win primary next week in his home state of Ohio. Still, Kasich's only hope of becoming the GOP nominee appears to rest on corralling establishment support if Marco Rubio exits the race and hoping that a convention fight could deprive Trump of the nomination.The results mark another miserable night for Rubio. The Florida senator was in fourth place in both of the big races.

A video posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 11:26am PST\"We are not Denmark,\" Hillary Clinton responded. The senator's affinity for the Danish society has stretched back years. In 2013, after hosting the Danish Prime Minister on a tour of his home state of Vermont, Sanders wrote an essay praising their model of government. \"In Denmark, there is a very different understanding of what 'freedom' means,\" Sanders wrote, arguing the U.S. could learn from the way the Danes have \"gone a long way to ending the enormous anxieties that comes with economic insecurity.\"\"Instead of promoting a system which allows a few to have enormous wealth, they have developed a system which guarantees a strong minimal standard of living to all -- including the children, the elderly and the disabled,\" Sanders added.I went to Copenhagen after Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire to see what they think about our election. Bernie is all over the news in Denmark. A photo posted by Chris Moody (@chrismoodycnn) on Feb 16, 2016 at 10:56am PSTWhile the Danes are flattered by all the attention, they want to ensure that the love coming from Sanders doesn't confuse people into thinking they describe themselves \"socialists,\" too. Sanders has clarified that his democratic socialism is not the same as \"socialist\" in the traditional sense of a purely government-controlled economy. But that hasn't stopped Danish leaders from ensuring there is no misconception about their own system.\"I would like to make one thing clear,\" Danish Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen said recently in a speech at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \"Denmark is far from a socialist planned economy. Denmark is a market economy.\"But it is a market with many differences from the United States. All Danish citizens have access to child care, state-guaranteed medical and parental leave from work, free college tuition in which students receive a paycheck from the government during enrollment, free health care and a generous pension, all of which Sanders supports.\"Free\" is actually the wrong word to describe these services. Danes pay some of the highest taxes in the world, including a 25% tax on all goods and services, a top marginal tax rate hovering near 60%. The top tax rate in the U.S., by comparison, is less than 40%.But there are aspects to the Danish model that you would never see on Sanders' policy platform. As a small country heavily reliant on trade, Denmark imposes minimal tariffs on foreign goods. Businesses here are only lightly regulated. The corporate tax rate is much lower than in the United States, which has one of the highest in the world. There's not even a minimum wage in Denmark, although most workers are paid high salaries in large part due to the strength of labor unions. And in the past few years, Danish voters elected a right-of-center government, which has been instituting reforms that have put tighter restrictions on access to the long-held safety net.Houses stretch along a canal in CopenhagenThe recent changes have caught the attention of conservative and libertarian think tanks in North America that rank levels of economic freedom around the world. Over the past few years, studies conducted by the Heritage Foundation, Wall Street Journal, the Cato Institute and the Canadian Fraser Institute have ranked Denmark as having actually more economic freedom than the United States.\"There is this idea that we are a heavily regulated society with a closed economy. The opposite is true,\" said Bo Lidegaard, the executive editor-in-chief of Politiken, one of Denmark's leading newspapers. \"If by socialist you mean regulated, restrictive, the individual is not free to do what she or he wants, that is not what we have here. We have a society where the individual is perhaps freer than any other society because the government is securing the social contract so comprehensively.\"In terms of pure semantics, few Danish politicians today would characterize themselves as \"socialist\"--even a \"democratic socialist\"--as Sanders does. The word has largely fallen out of fashion in recent decades. \"When I hear Bernie Sanders talk about himself as a democratic socialist, it's a little bit 1970s,\" said Lars Christensen, a Danish economist known here as an outspoken critic of his homeland's model. \"The major political parties on the center-left and the center-right would oppose many of the proposals of Bernie Sanders on the regulatory side as being too leftist.\"Related: What is Bernie Sanders' 'democratic socialism?'Could the U.S. adopt the Danish model?JUST WATCHEDCould the Danish welfare state ever work in the United States? ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCould the Danish welfare state ever work in the United States?01:15As even Sanders has conceded, the differences between the United States and Denmark are striking. In many ways, Denmark's success depends on its small size. The country has a population of just 5.6 million -- about the same as Minnesota's -- and itsterritory makes up just 16,000 square miles, about half the size of South Carolina. By comparison, the United States has a population of more than 300 million and encompasses 3.8 million square miles.Unlike the United States' diverse population of immigrants, Denmark is ethnically homogenous -- nearly 90% are of Danish ancestry, according to The Danish Ministry of Social Affairs and Integration -- making political consensus easier than in the United States. \"I think this system is only possible because we essentially are all the same,\" said Christensen. \"Maybe if you wanted to introduce such a scheme in Utah, you could do that. But doing it across the U.S., I find it completely and utterly impossible just for the mere fact that Americans are all so different.\"Danish citizens also seem to have a higher comfort level and trust in government than in the United States. One would be hard-pressed to find a mainstream Danish politician who would agree with Ronald Reagan's axiom that, \"the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, 'I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\" While Americans have a deep-seated distrust of government that was imprinted on the nation's soul in the Bill of Rights, the Danish just don't view their government's size as a recipe for tyranny. \"The question is not how much tax you pay or how big your government is, it's whether it works,\" Lidegaard said. \"It's whether you get return on your payment. We pay a lot of taxes, but we get a lot in return.\"The Danish also participate in the democratic process on a scale unheard of in the United States. More than 85% of Danish citizens participated in the nation's general election in 2015; Only 55% of Americans went to the polls in 2012. A system challenged by a changing worldJUST WATCHEDThe Danish government has since enacted the bill profiled in this video.ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe Danish government has since enacted the bill profiled in this video. 03:33Sanders would also probably have concerns with the way Denmark has handled the European migrant crisis. While Denmark is accustomed to international media's fawning over its safety net and consistent ranking by research organizations as having the happiest citizens in the world, the government has come under severe criticism for how it has handled the recent wave of immigrants coming from the war-torn Middle East. Fearful that the thousands of refugees pouring in the European Union from Iraq and Syria could threaten their society, the Danish government has gone to great -- and controversial -- lengths to dissuade migrants from settling in their country. The most problematic move came when the government passed a law that would grant the state the right to seize possessions worth more than the equivalent of about $1,500 from refugees settling in Denmark who seek aid from the government. The law includes a carve-out for items of \"special sentimental value,\" but the critical reaction from human rights groups was swift and punishing. The law also increases the number of years refugees would have to wait to bring family members into the country and it made it more difficult for them to obtain permanent residency. Its passage comes amid the rise of the right-wing Danish People's Party, which has made combating immigration a chief priority. \"There is an inherent contradiction between a welfare state where all your life you pay taxes to have coverage -- health, social costs, etc. -- and then being in the country as a migrant only part of your life,\" said Lidegaard. \"The problem with the law -- and there is one -- is that it's trying to send a signal: Immigrants in Europe, don't go here. Don't come to Denmark. The signal sent that way is a stupid signal to send. That's the purpose of the law. It's not a practical measure.\"Before the law passed, Denmark's Ministry of Immigration, Integration and Housing published ads in Arab and English-language newspapers in Lebanon, where more than 1 million Syrian refugees live, warning immigrants that Denmark will be an unwelcoming place for them. The fear, generally, is that the foreign culture brought by the refugees would not align with traditional Danish customs and disrupt the recipe for what makes the welfare state possible. \"There is a limit to how many immigrants we can take in from a different culture who don't speak the language and how fast we can turn them into becoming citizens that are part of society, that are able to function and contribute to the wealth of our society,\" said Lidegaard.\"So we have a lot of focus now on how we integrate newcomers. How we turn immigrants into citizens who are part of production, part of taxpaying, part of paying the bill.\"The Danes are watching usJUST WATCHEDWhat the Danish people think about Sanders, Trump and the US election process ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWhat the Danish people think about Sanders, Trump and the US election process01:51Even though Danes are eager participants in their own elections, the amount of time they spend watching and discussing our elections is a phenomenon to behold. \"American politics is really, really popular in Denmark,\" said Anders Agner Pedersen, a Danish journalist who edits Kongressen, a news outlet that exclusively American politics for a Danish audience. \"It basically is in the news every day.\"Pedersen, who has to stay up all night to watch American presidential debates and state primary returns from Denmark, is swamped with bookings on Danish television and radio programs to explain the election process and analyze the daily horse race.

And just this month, Ted Cruz set Danish media aflame when he suggested that Donald Trump was so unhinged he's liable to drop an atom bomb on Denmark. The Danes were bewildered: Why us?As the campaign marches on with Trump still riding high in the polls, his ongoing success is starting to become a concern here. \"In the beginning I thought it was a joke. Then we realized people were voting for Trump,\" Jonas Pedersen, a medical student at the University of Copenhagen, said. Another medical student, Helena Boegh, said, \"That some people would actually vote for Donald Trump and in the same country would vote for someone who likes the system we have in Denmark -- that really says something about America.\"", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Story by Chris Moody and original video by Alexander Rosen, CNN"}

It's what Michigan portends for Ohio, Missouri and Illinois, which all vote next Tuesday. For an alleged one-note candidate, Sanders is singing the right tune, especially with his focus on economic injustice. He's giving a home to voters angry over job losses due to trade deals or home foreclosures due to Wall Street's greed. Clinton's failed attack against Sanders on the auto bailout during Sunday's CNN debate in Flint, Michigan, didn't pass the smell test in an auto-driven state that knows its history. Sanders voted for the auto bailout as a stand-alone measure. What he opposed was a much larger Wall Street bailout later on -- a portion of which included money used to rescue the auto industry.Clinton's blowout win in Mississippi means she will pick up more delegates than Sanders. And it shows her huge advantage among African-Americans continues to be a firewall she can count on. But that strength has obscured her weakness among white voters -- which now looks problematic: After Florida and North Carolina next week, the South is done voting.To see the problem, look at Clinton's calendar. She concentrated nearly all of her five days of Michigan campaigning in Wayne County, the heavily-populated and heavily-African-American home of Detroit. Sanders, meanwhile, competed across the state, and outperformed expectations in other minority-heavy communities.Trump romps Donald Trump is eating everybody else's lunch.He bested Cruz in Mississippi among the two groups the Texas senator had bet big on: Evangelicals, who narrowly went for Trump, and voters angry at government, who gave Trump a two-to-one advantage over Cruz. In Michigan, Trump drowned out Kasich's modest Midwestern job-creating executive appeal, blasting away at trade deals and winning big among the Reagan Democrats he says he can bring into the GOP fold.Trump bragged in his victory speech Tuesday night that television ads and shots from rivals have done nothing to slow his rise.\"There has never been more money spent on hitting somebody than was spent on me,\" Trump said. \"Every single one who's attacked me is gone, and I'm very proud of that, because that's what we should have for our country.\" Brushing aside attack ads aimed at undermining his business credentials, Trump taunted his critics by holding his election-night event at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida -- and catering it with products like Trump wines, water and steaks. Trump seems able to absorb all the hits and come out stronger. CNN analyst Van Jones compared Trump to an X-Men villain played on film by Kevin Bacon. \"There's a villain in Marvel Comics called Sebastian Shaw, and the harder you hit him, the stronger he gets,\" Jones said on CNN Tuesday evening. Trump's opponents treated him that way. \"You couldn't hit him, don't fight him, knock other people off,\" Jones said. \"We're going to see how many bullets he can eat.\" One potentially worrying sign for Trump is that he doesn't win among voters who decided in the last few days. Cruz bested him with those voters in Mississippi. Working in Trump's favor, though, is that those voters haven't yet settled into any specific camp. A week ago, for example, they went to Rubio. In Michigan, it was Kasich gaining steam late. Clinton's trade problemHillary Clinton's husband signed NAFTA. She voted for trade deals in the Senate. And she was among the last Democrats to stake out a position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership.Clinton has nuanced explanations for all of that. Still, Sanders -- who has raged against all of these deals from the beginning, and features trade as a staple of his stump speech and his attacks on Clinton on debate and town hall stages -- is making her pay for it.In Michigan, where 15% of all workers are labor union members, 58% of Democratic voters said they believe trade takes away U.S. jobs, according to exit polls. Of those voters, 60% went for Sanders, while 39% went for Clinton.Similar margins could hurt Clinton in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri next week. Trade is the single best example of a populist uprising that spans the partisan divide.Trump's nearly obsessive focus on blasting every U.S. trade deal and everyone who negotiated them guarantees that if he and Clinton are the nominees, this wouldn't just be a problem for Clinton in the primary.If she advances to face Trump, it'd represent a reversal of modern American politics: An anti-trade Republican against a Democrat much more comfortable with trade.It's enough to make Reagan Democrats fawn and Chamber of Commerce-types quake.\"We will take many, many people away from the Democrats,\" Trump said Tuesday night.Marco Rubio's magic is goneMarco Rubio crashed in Michigan and Mississippi, finishing fourth in both. Worse, he didn't get close to cracking the 15% needed in either state to win any delegates.\"It sure looks like a collapse to me,\" CNN Senior Political Commentator David Axelrod said. This was supposed to be when Rubio made his move. He's spent two Republican debates unloading everything he had on Trump, while big donors hoisted anti-Trump attack ads onto the airwaves.Then, the theory went, Rubio would head home to Florida and capture next week's winner-take-all contest and 99 delegates.Instead, Rubio will only face questions all week about his strategy and what went wrong.He acknowledged that he's in a fight for his political life Tuesday night in Ponte Vedra, Florida, signaling that he'll hunker down at home. \"I believe with all my heart that the winner of the Florida primary next Tuesday will be the nominee of the Republican Party,\" Rubio said.Hope for Cruz and KasichThey didn't beat Trump. But they both clobbered Rubio -- and got some news that could help them moving forward. Cruz picked up Idaho, a reliably conservative state that only has 32 delegates, but lets him continue his argument that he's the top candidate of the #NeverTrump movement. Among voters who decided whom to support in the past few days, Kasich won the most in Michigan and Cruz won the most in Mississippi. That's a sign both have room to grow, particularly if Rubio loses Florida and is knocked out of the race before it shifts to more moderate Eastern states where Rubio would likely have more support. Kasich claimed momentum, telling supporters in a late-night fundraising email that \"I surged to an unexpectedly strong finish.\" Not that he had anywhere to go but up. To date, Kasich's campaign has been about three states: New Hampshire, then Michigan, then Ohio. It's earned him some jeers from opponents who are running national races. But that strategy -- plus his affable debate-stage demeanor -- have allowed him to avoid other Republicans' targets, too. If he can win the 66 delegate, winner-take-all Ohio next week, he could put himself on a course to rack up enough delegates to be a player at the Republican National Convention in his home state of Ohio.", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Eric Bradner, CNN"}

Jeb Bush, who has since dropped out.JUST WATCHEDMarco Rubio looks to avoid 'establishment' labelReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMarco Rubio looks to avoid 'establishment' label 02:00But supporters dismissed concerns about his middling polling position and relatively thin resume after hearing him speak.Alfredo Ortega, chief of staff for the city of Doral, Florida, said he believed because Rubio is a \"phenomenal politician\" he could overcome many of the hurdles he faced.Ortega, who came to America from Venezuela 11 years ago, said he saw Rubio's ability to win support from both the \"Anglo and Hispanic worlds\" as one of his major assets.And it's that eloquence, then said Florida GOP strategist Rick Wilson, who now works for a pro-Rubio super PAC, that would help Rubio overcome the \"static\" in the field.\"Marco Rubio has a certain fluency, and ability to connect with voters, and this will be one of the first times a wider audience has seen it,\" said Wilson.A tea party pastRubio faced the challenge of maintaining establishment interest while growing his appeal among conservatives. The right remains wary of Rubio for partnering with Democrats on an ultimately failed immigration reform bill after riding into office on the 2010 tea party wave.But Rubio is looking to carve out a path as the candidate who's not too far right to lack credibility nationally, and yet not too squishy on conservative priorities such as guns and same-sex marriage to lose the Republican base.Rubio has eschewed the bomb-throwing of conservatives such as Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and real estate mogul Donald Trump and the vacillations of some of the party's more establishment-minded candidates.His career in politics -- which began with a stint as West Miami city commissioner and found him ascending to House speaker before his upset U.S. Senate win in 2010 -- has been centered on pragmatism, supporters say.He was the first in the 2016 field to declare, without reservations, that parents \"absolutely\" should vaccinate their children. He repeatedly asserted that it was impossible to defund President Barack Obama's immigration executive order by shutting down the Department of Homeland Security.Focus on foreign policyBut on other issues -- particular foreign policy -- Rubio has railed against the administration. He led the charge against the Obama administration's move to thaw relations with Cuba last year, appearing on nearly every major news network to slam the policy shift as shortsighted and scheduling hearings as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Western Hemisphere Subcommittee on the issue.It gave him an opportunity to emphasize his personal narrative as the son of Cuban immigrants and his lifelong criticism of the Castro regime. 20 photos: Moments from Marco Rubio's career20 photos: Moments from Marco Rubio's careerFlorida Sen.

He's spoken favorably about higher taxes on the wealthy. And he talks up protecting Social Security and Medicare in the social insurance programs' current forms, rather than making them more state-based, as some other Republican candidates advocate.", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Jeremy Diamond, CNN"}

A Quinnipiac poll released two weeks ago put Rubio behind Trump by a wider margin: 44% to 28%.Most of the senator's advisers agree he does not have a path to the nomination and some are advising him to get out ahead of the March 15 primary.Sources within the campaign also say the pressure will only continue to mount following an expected disappointing showing Tuesday, when voters in Michigan, Mississippi, Hawaii and Idaho make their picks in the GOP primary.\"Not going to have a great day is an understatement,\" one campaign source said.Weighing the costsThere are two lines of thought within the campaign: getting out before Florida, and hanging in there.On the one hand, some advisers are warning that if Rubio does poorly in his home state, it could not only hurt his presidential campaign but also his future politically, including a potential gubernatorial run in 2018 or chance to be on the ticket as a vice presidential candidate.RELATED: Florida poll: Trump leads Rubio\"Cruz won his home state. If Rubio can't win his, that's a problem,\" one prominent supporter said.But others within the campaign are urging Rubio to stay in the race, predicting a better-than-expected finish in Florida. Rubio's victory for his Senate seat against the governor makes him optimistic he can come from behind, said one source close to the campaign. The senator also believes his experience in the state translates to a superior ground game and infrastructure than that of his competitors. The latter line of thinking seems to be winning, for the moment. But a particularly awful Tuesday could change the rationale, a source warned. The endorsement gameOne potential x-factor in the Florida contest is the looming possibility of an endorsement from once-rival Jeb Bush. But Rubio and Bush, the former Florida governor, have spoken three times since Bush dropped out of the 2016 last month and the Rubio campaign is not expecting an endorsement.Rubio raised the possibility in the latter two conversations, sources said, but felt Bush was \"vague about his interest\" and Rubio came away under the impression that Bush would not endorse. RELATED: GOP seeks Bush's billionairesThe fellow Floridian is a long-time friend and mentor of Rubio's, but they clashed as opponents during the GOP primary. Many of Bush's backers endorsed Rubio after the former governor departed the race, and others who had stayed out of it put their support behind Rubio.But not all of Bush's supporters moved over, and some talk of bad blood has hung over the relationship between the two campaigns.Romney roleOther political insiders are closely watching to see what former Massachusetts Gov.

She will now look to big state contests next Tuesday in Ohio, Florida, North Carolina and Illinois to restore her momentum.Sanders acknowledged that the Michigan vote was close, but thanked voters for \"repudiating\" polls that indicated Clinton had stronger support in the state.\"What tonight means is that the Bernie Sanders campaign, the people's revolution that we're talking about, the political revolution that we're talking about, is strong in every part of the country,\" Sanders said. \"And, frankly, we believe our strongest areas are yet to happen.\"Even the Sanders camp appeared to be surprised by the victory, as the candidate held a rally for supporters in Florida hours before his victory was confirmed.\"We didn't know at the end whether we were going to get over the hump or not,\" Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN. He predicted that with most Southern states now out of the way, the calendar was turning in favor of the senator.The Clinton campaign put a brave face on the defeat, by about two percent of the vote, after earlier warning that the race was much closer than polls that gave Clinton a big lead suggested.Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri said their strategy \"is built around accruing delegates and we will come out on top on delegates.\"Even though she lost Michigan to Sanders, Clinton actually won more delegates on the night, according to a CNN estimate, picking up 84 to Sanders' 67.

That figure includes super delegates, party officials and officeholders who have said they will back her.Sanders has 567 delegates overall.Clinton team shaken by close raceThe former first lady and her rival have clashed repeatedly in recent days over issues that are vital to Michigan voters. Clinton hammered her rival over a vote against a bailout for the U.S. auto industry in 2009, while the senator lambasted her over her past support for free-trade deals that he said sowed ruin in the Midwest.\"What these trade agreements have done is decimate community after community in the Midwest and all over America,\" Sanders said in the state on Monday. \"I have helped lead the opposition to every one of these disastrous trade agreements,\" he said, \"because I knew what they would do.\"JUST WATCHEDClinton: Campaigns should be about results, not insultsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClinton: Campaigns should be about results, not insults 01:47Clinton's team was shaken by the close Michigan race, sources told CNN's Jeff Zeleny. Michigan Democrats who are aligned with Clinton's campaign do not believe that Clinton's attack on Sanders' position on the auto bailout worked as they intended.There is second guessing among some Democrats that some people in Clinton's organization started looking beyond the primary to a general election contest against Trump.\"They didn't take Sanders for granted as much as voters,\" said one top Democrat close to the campaign.Clinton told supporters on Monday that \"the sooner I could become your nominee, the more I could begin to turn my attention to the Republicans.\"For the latest news and political buzz get the CNN Politics Nightcap | Sign upAttacks leave Trump undiminishedTrump's strong performance -- he has now won 14 states -- suggests that his capacity to win is undiminished despite a barrage of attacks by his rivals and the Republican establishment on his personality, his sometimes vulgar campaign style and his fitness to serve as president.In a news conference Tuesday night, Trump said the results were a repudiation of \"so many horrible, horrible things\" said about him over the last week, which he said added up to \"$38 million worth of horrible lies.\" He added: \"It shows you how brilliant the public is because they knew they were lies.\"With 97% of the Michigan vote in at 1 a.m. ET, Trump was in the lead at 36.5%. Cruz was in second place at 24.9% and Ohio Gov. John Kasich was at 24.3%. With 95% of the Mississippi vote in, Trump was in first at 47.3% followed by Cruz at 36.3% and Kasich at 8.8%.The Michigan results could provide a lift to Kasich if he has a second-place finish, or is a close third. That performance is a good omen for his must-win primary next week in his home state of Ohio. Still, Kasich's only hope of becoming the GOP nominee appears to rest on corralling establishment support if Marco Rubio exits the race and hoping that a convention fight could deprive Trump of the nomination.The results mark another miserable night for Rubio. The Florida senator was in fourth place in both of the big races. Such a poor showing will add to impressions that the campaign of a man seen as a rising star of the Republican Party is fading fast.", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Stephen Collinson, CNN"}

At issue there is whether non members of a public sector union can be compelled to pay fees for collective bargaining. If the court were to rule with the challengers it could severely weaken labor coffers at a time when unions in general are in decline. A lower court ruled in favor of the unions. After oral arguments, court watchers believed that the Court might be poised to reverse that decision. It was expected that Justice Anthony Kennedy might join the conservatives in a 5-4 vote. With Scalia's death, that case might well now turn out to be 4-4. That means the lower court decision that ruled in favor of the unions would stand. AbortionOn abortion, next month, justices will hear a case challenging parts of a Texas abortion law that requires that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital and mandates that clinics upgrade their facilities to hospital-like standards.Abortion rights supporters say the law is one of the strictest in the nation and that if the Supreme Court agrees with a lower court's decision and allows two provisions of the law to go into effect, the number of available clinics in the state is expected to fall to about 10. The lower court allowed the Texas law to remain. Kennedy will be key here. If he votes with the liberals, it's likely a 5-3 decision to overturn. If he votes with the conservatives it could be 4-4 which would mean the Texas law could stand. One person, one voteScalia's death might also impact a voting redistricting case challenging the \"one person, one vote\" doctrine in a dispute that could change the way that states draw their legislative lines. In that case the challengers prevailed in the lower court. The principle dating back to 1960s is that state legislative districts must be drawn so they are equal in population. But justices never explicitly answered whether the doctrine applies to the general population or the voting population.Civil rights groups are watching the case carefully, fearful that if the court rules with the plaintiffs, it could potentially shift power from urban areas -- districts that tend to include a higher percentage of individuals not eligible to vote such as non-citizens, released felons and children -- to rural areas that are more likely to favor Republicans.Immigration and ObamacareOn immigration, the court will consider whether President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration should survive.Texas and 25 other states are challenging the programs that would allow millions of undocumented immigrants to apply for programs that could make them eligible for work authorization and some associated benefits. Lower courts have so far sided with Texas and temporarily frozen the programs from going into effect. The 8-person court means the administration would need to turn Kennedy or Chief Justice John Roberts to win.The most complicated case could be the lawsuit challenging the Obamacare contraception mandate. This case is a challenge from religious nonprofit groups, including the Little Sisters of the Poor, to requirement that demands group health plans provide a full range of contraceptive coverage to women at no cost. The issue here is that unlike the other cases, this case came out of multiple circuits that didn't all rule the same way. A 4-4 decision wouldn't be decisive at all, making this a likely candidate for the court to hold over.In the coming weeks, the court could signal that it was going to \"hold over\" some cases that might be 4-4 but it would be more likely the justices would do that if they thought there would be a new justice confirmed in the short term.", "article_highlights": "The death of Justice Antonin Scalia complicates several high-profile cases set to be heard this termIf the court is equally divided in a case, ruling 4-4, it means the lower court opinion stands and there is no precedent set by the Supreme Court", "article_author": "Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court Reporter"}

Billionaire businessman Donald Trump has declared that he has a \"great relationship with God,\" and Christianity is a centerpiece of the pitch Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are making to Republican primary voters, especially the evangelicals who make up a crucial part of the party's base.READ: Democratic candidates discuss the importance of their faithThe reasons Sanders' religion hasn't gotten more attention, however, go beyond his own rhetorical decision. They also speak to the evolution in attitudes towards Jews in American society.\"What we see is that the vast majority of the American public, 80%, say (a candidate being Jewish) would not make a difference in their vote, one way or the other,\" said Greg Smith, the associate director of research at Pew Research Center, referring to a survey published on Wednesday. \"The remainder are pretty much evenly divided between those who say they would be more likely to vote for a Jewish candidate and those who say they would be less likely to vote for a Jewish candidate.\"The response led Pew to categorize Judaism in political contestants as being among \"traits that are neither assets or liabilities,\" the same as for evangelicals. By contrast, being Mormon or Muslim was assessed to be a potential difficulty.Steve Rabinowitz, a veteran Democratic operative, Jewish activist and, notably, a Clinton supporter, describes Sanders' religion as being hardly \"noteworthy\" -- at least, not outside his own community. \"We are at the point where a Jew running for office is entirely no big deal,\" Rabinowitz told CNN. \"Nationally, we're there. We're so much there that for a lot of Jews the fact that Bernie Sanders does not more embrace his Jewish identity is an issue rather than the idea that he might do better if he hid it more.\"Maisel, author of the 2001 book \"Jews in American Politics,\" agreed that Sanders' religion was not a vulnerability.\"I did an interview with an Israeli newspaper last week, who said, 'Isn't this amazing? Aren't people going to vote against him because he's Jewish?,\" related Maisel. \"I said, 'No, they're going to vote against him because he's too liberal.\"Or perhaps because he's too secular.JUST WATCHEDClinton and Sanders argue over who's progressiveReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClinton and Sanders argue over who's progressive 02:40According to Pew, the question of religion versus religiosity yields a more instructive answer than any related to a specific faith. While 8 in 10 said their votes wouldn't be influenced, for better or worse, upon finding out a candidate is Jewish, more than half, 51%, said they would be less likely to support one who \"does not believe in God.\" Jews themselves, however, don't necessarily see religious belief as key to identifying as Jewish. A 2013 Pew Research Center survey found that just 15% of American Jewry said being Jewish was \"mainly a matter of religion,\" with the rest listing ancestry and culture as more important.And while Sanders might not be observant -- as evidenced by his decision to give a speech at the evangelical Liberty University on the first day of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah -- he told the press at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor in June that \"I'm proud to be Jewish.\"When invoking his religious background, Sanders has sought to make the case that it is one that would help America progress.After GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson said in October that he could not abide a Muslim president, Sanders delivered a political rebuke wrapped inside a personal history.\"Let me be very personal here if I might. I'm Jewish. My father's family died in concentration camps,\" he told student supporters in Virginia a few days later. \"I will do everything that I can to rid this country of the ugly stain of racism which has existed for far too many years.\"READ: That time Bernie Sanders played a rabbi in a movieIndeed, Sanders is the first self-identified Jew to win a primary. Though Barry Goldwater, who garnered the Republican nomination in 1964, had a Jewish father, he was raised and considered himself to be Episcopalian.For Rabinowitz, the see-sawing fortunes of former Connecticut Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman offers further proof that Jewish politicians have become subject to many of the same headwinds faced by their gentile colleagues.\"Al Gore's selection of Joe Lieberman to be his running mate was a big damn deal. It was a big deal in the community. It was a tremendous point of ethnic pride,\" Rabinowitz said of the 2000 presidential race. \"And yet, four years later when he ran on his own for president, he got almost no support.\" Lieberman, as a candidate and in office, wore his religion differently than Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist whose liberal politics owe more to the New Deal and union leaders like Eugene V. Debs than any Talmudic imperative.Despite their different styles, the fortunes of both Lieberman -- an Orthodox Jew who does not work on the Sabbath -- and Sanders, who hews more closely to the cultural and ethnic Judaism that has become a staple of American popular culture, represent a wholesale departure from the era of restricted clubs and hotels that banned Jewish men and women, and from the time when a young senator from Massachusetts had to give a speech reassuring voters that he wouldn't be taking orders from the Catholic Church.\"It's akin to the fact that there are now three Jewish justices on the Supreme Court whereas decades ago, people would have said there's one Jewish seat on the Supreme Court,\" Nathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union's Advocacy Center, said of Sanders and the changed environment for Jews in politics. \"Thankfully, Jews and Judaism are much more accepted as part of American society today than decades ago, where a Jew reaching high levels of leadership is accepted.\"It remains to be seen how Sanders would fare in a general election race where the spotlight only glares more strongly on every aspect of a candidate's background, and how his religion would be perceived by a Republican Party that tends to be more focused on faith and receptive to Christian references than Democrats.JUST WATCHEDBernie's brother predicts big thingsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBernie's brother predicts big things 03:29The same Pew survey found that 64% of Republicans say it's \"important\" to have a president who shares their religious beliefs as compared to 41% of Democrats. Diament, however, noted that Lieberman was well-regarded by evangelicals.And asked what a general election with Sanders as the Democratic nominee might look like, Smith at Pew also pointed to some recent history for guidance.\"In 2012, we saw that there were significant numbers of Americans who had reservations about Mormonism, particularly evangelicals,\" he said, but he noted that in the end what really mattered was party affiliation.\"If it came right down to it and it was a choice between a Republican, Mitt Romney, who was Mormon, or the Democratic incumbent Barack Obama, the choice was going to clear for them: They may have reservations about Mormonism, but that wasn't going to stop them from voting for Mitt Romney,\" he said.Yet even as national politics has come to welcome them, Jewish citizens, who make up only about 2% of the American voting population, remain the most frequently targeted religious group.According to the most recent FBI statistics, more than 56% of the 1,140 documented anti-religious hate crimes in 2014 were motivated by anti-Jewish bias. In Western Europe, Jews have come under increasing threat from right-wing groups and, in certain high-profile cases, Islamic extremists.Still, Maisel believes those lingering hatreds, even as they occasionally erupt in spasms of violence, have become an outlier in the broader national culture.\"Anti-Semitism is not a value of the majority of the American people,\" he said. \"So if politicians play to it, that's a losing strategy.\"", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Gregory Krieg, CNN"}

On the other side of the coin, 43% of those who watched said Chafee had the worst night, 31% thought Webb did, 12% O'Malley.Among those Democrats who watched the debate, both Sanders and Biden are viewed more favorably than they are among Democratic voters generally: Sanders' favorability number bumps from 62% among all Democratic voters to 84% among debate viewers, while Biden climbs from 76% to 89% favorable. Clinton's numbers are about the same in both groups.READ: Larry David's Bernie Sanders joins 'SNL' political impersonations hall of fameDespite their positive feelings toward Biden, debate-watchers are more apt than others to say Biden should stay out of the contest (61% think he should not run, compared with 43% of those who did not watch) and they are far more likely to be satisfied with the Democratic field generally (84% compared with 64% among those who didn't watch).Assessing the lesser-known candidates, debate-watchers are more positive than other Democrats toward O'Malley, (44% favorable compared with 20% among Democratic voters generally). But Webb and Chafee are both viewed more negatively among those who watched (For Chafee, 32% unfavorable among debate-watchers vs. 18% among all Democratic voters; Webb is at 37% unfavorable among debate-watchers, 20% among all Democratic voters).Following the debate, Clinton continues to dominate as the more trusted candidate across several top issues, with double-digit advantages over Sanders and Biden as the candidate who would best handle the economy, health care, foreign policy, race relations, climate change and gun policy. Clinton also now holds a small edge over Sanders as most trusted on income inequality (43% Clinton, 38% Sanders).23 photos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlight23 photos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlightU.S. Sen.

Exceptions are income inequality (50% of debate-watchers trust Sanders vs. 36% for Clinton) and climate change (40% each say Clinton and Sanders would be best able to handle that). Sanders gained no ground, however, on foreign policy. On that question, Clinton's strength grows among those who watched: 77% in that group say they trust her most to handle foreign policy, up from 66% among Democratic voters overall.On two issues where the debate highlighted differences among the candidates, fissures within the Democratic electorate on who would best handle them emerge.Income inequality appears to be the most divisive issue, with women, older voters, those without college degrees, moderates and those with lower incomes more apt to trust Clinton on the issue, while those with college degrees, liberals, and urbanites are more likely to favor Sanders.And on gun policy, there's a sharp gender divide. Women are far more likely to say they trust Clinton to handle it than men, 50% to 37%. Democratic gun owners are more evenly split on the question, with 35% saying they trust Clinton most on gun policy, 27% Sanders and 21% Biden. Among those Democrats who do not own guns, it's 48% Clinton, 21% Biden and 16% Sanders. 10 photos: The first Democratic debate10 photos: The first Democratic debateDemocratic presidential candidates take the stage before debating in Las Vegas on Tuesday, October 13.

While the share \"very satisfied\" has risen from 26% to 33%, the share saying they are at least fairly satisfied has held steady at about 7-in-10. Women do report feeling more satisfied with the field than men, but younger Democrats, a key group for Barack Obama's general election victories, are far less satisfied with this field of candidates than older Democrats. Only about one-quarter of those under age 50 say they are very satisfied, compared with 40% of those age 50 or older.When matched against the top candidates from the Republican field, Clinton, Sanders and Biden all top Donald Trump, who has been leading most polling on the Republican nomination contest since this summer. But Biden is the only one who holds a significant lead over Ben Carson, a more recent addition to the top of the Republican field. Trump trails Clinton by 5, Sanders by 9 and Biden by 10. But against Carson, both Clinton (47% to Carson's 48%) and Sanders (46% to Carson's 48%) run about evenly with the former neurosurgeon. Biden tops Carson by 8 points.The CNN/ORC International Poll was conducted by telephone October 14-17 among a random national sample of 1,028 adult Americans. Results among the 425 registered voters who say they are Democrats or independents who lean toward the Democratic Party have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "Most Democrats who watched the Democratic debate think Hillary Clinton had the best performance of the night, a new poll showsOverall, 31% of registered Democrats say they watched", "article_author": "Jennifer Agiesta, CNN Polling Director"}

Billionaire businessman Donald Trump has declared that he has a \"great relationship with God,\" and Christianity is a centerpiece of the pitch Sens. Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio are making to Republican primary voters, especially the evangelicals who make up a crucial part of the party's base.READ: Democratic candidates discuss the importance of their faithThe reasons Sanders' religion hasn't gotten more attention, however, go beyond his own rhetorical decision. They also speak to the evolution in attitudes towards Jews in American society.\"What we see is that the vast majority of the American public, 80%, say (a candidate being Jewish) would not make a difference in their vote, one way or the other,\" said Greg Smith, the associate director of research at Pew Research Center, referring to a survey published on Wednesday. \"The remainder are pretty much evenly divided between those who say they would be more likely to vote for a Jewish candidate and those who say they would be less likely to vote for a Jewish candidate.\"The response led Pew to categorize Judaism in political contestants as being among \"traits that are neither assets or liabilities,\" the same as for evangelicals. By contrast, being Mormon or Muslim was assessed to be a potential difficulty.Steve Rabinowitz, a veteran Democratic operative, Jewish activist and, notably, a Clinton supporter, describes Sanders' religion as being hardly \"noteworthy\" -- at least, not outside his own community. \"We are at the point where a Jew running for office is entirely no big deal,\" Rabinowitz told CNN. \"Nationally, we're there. We're so much there that for a lot of Jews the fact that Bernie Sanders does not more embrace his Jewish identity is an issue rather than the idea that he might do better if he hid it more.\"Maisel, author of the 2001 book \"Jews in American Politics,\" agreed that Sanders' religion was not a vulnerability.\"I did an interview with an Israeli newspaper last week, who said, 'Isn't this amazing? Aren't people going to vote against him because he's Jewish?,\" related Maisel. \"I said, 'No, they're going to vote against him because he's too liberal.\"Or perhaps because he's too secular.JUST WATCHEDClinton and Sanders argue over who's progressiveReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClinton and Sanders argue over who's progressive 02:40According to Pew, the question of religion versus religiosity yields a more instructive answer than any related to a specific faith. While 8 in 10 said their votes wouldn't be influenced, for better or worse, upon finding out a candidate is Jewish, more than half, 51%, said they would be less likely to support one who \"does not believe in God.\" Jews themselves, however, don't necessarily see religious belief as key to identifying as Jewish. A 2013 Pew Research Center survey found that just 15% of American Jewry said being Jewish was \"mainly a matter of religion,\" with the rest listing ancestry and culture as more important.And while Sanders might not be observant -- as evidenced by his decision to give a speech at the evangelical Liberty University on the first day of the Jewish holiday of Rosh Hashanah -- he told the press at a breakfast hosted by The Christian Science Monitor in June that \"I'm proud to be Jewish.\"When invoking his religious background, Sanders has sought to make the case that it is one that would help America progress.After GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson said in October that he could not abide a Muslim president, Sanders delivered a political rebuke wrapped inside a personal history.\"Let me be very personal here if I might. I'm Jewish. My father's family died in concentration camps,\" he told student supporters in Virginia a few days later. \"I will do everything that I can to rid this country of the ugly stain of racism which has existed for far too many years.\"READ: That time Bernie Sanders played a rabbi in a movieIndeed, Sanders is the first self-identified Jew to win a primary. Though Barry Goldwater, who garnered the Republican nomination in 1964, had a Jewish father, he was raised and considered himself to be Episcopalian.For Rabinowitz, the see-sawing fortunes of former Connecticut Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman offers further proof that Jewish politicians have become subject to many of the same headwinds faced by their gentile colleagues.\"Al Gore's selection of Joe Lieberman to be his running mate was a big damn deal. It was a big deal in the community. It was a tremendous point of ethnic pride,\" Rabinowitz said of the 2000 presidential race. \"And yet, four years later when he ran on his own for president, he got almost no support.\" Lieberman, as a candidate and in office, wore his religion differently than Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist whose liberal politics owe more to the New Deal and union leaders like Eugene V. Debs than any Talmudic imperative.Despite their different styles, the fortunes of both Lieberman -- an Orthodox Jew who does not work on the Sabbath -- and Sanders, who hews more closely to the cultural and ethnic Judaism that has become a staple of American popular culture, represent a wholesale departure from the era of restricted clubs and hotels that banned Jewish men and women, and from the time when a young senator from Massachusetts had to give a speech reassuring voters that he wouldn't be taking orders from the Catholic Church.\"It's akin to the fact that there are now three Jewish justices on the Supreme Court whereas decades ago, people would have said there's one Jewish seat on the Supreme Court,\" Nathan Diament, executive director of the Orthodox Union's Advocacy Center, said of Sanders and the changed environment for Jews in politics. \"Thankfully, Jews and Judaism are much more accepted as part of American society today than decades ago, where a Jew reaching high levels of leadership is accepted.\"It remains to be seen how Sanders would fare in a general election race where the spotlight only glares more strongly on every aspect of a candidate's background, and how his religion would be perceived by a Republican Party that tends to be more focused on faith and receptive to Christian references than Democrats.JUST WATCHEDBernie's brother predicts big thingsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBernie's brother predicts big things 03:29The same Pew survey found that 64% of Republicans say it's \"important\" to have a president who shares their religious beliefs as compared to 41% of Democrats. Diament, however, noted that Lieberman was well-regarded by evangelicals.And asked what a general election with Sanders as the Democratic nominee might look like, Smith at Pew also pointed to some recent history for guidance.\"In 2012, we saw that there were significant numbers of Americans who had reservations about Mormonism, particularly evangelicals,\" he said, but he noted that in the end what really mattered was party affiliation.\"If it came right down to it and it was a choice between a Republican, Mitt Romney, who was Mormon, or the Democratic incumbent Barack Obama, the choice was going to clear for them: They may have reservations about Mormonism, but that wasn't going to stop them from voting for Mitt Romney,\" he said.Yet even as national politics has come to welcome them, Jewish citizens, who make up only about 2% of the American voting population, remain the most frequently targeted religious group.According to the most recent FBI statistics, more than 56% of the 1,140 documented anti-religious hate crimes in 2014 were motivated by anti-Jewish bias. In Western Europe, Jews have come under increasing threat from right-wing groups and, in certain high-profile cases, Islamic extremists.Still, Maisel believes those lingering hatreds, even as they occasionally erupt in spasms of violence, have become an outlier in the broader national culture.\"Anti-Semitism is not a value of the majority of the American people,\" he said. \"So if politicians play to it, that's a losing strategy.\"", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Gregory Krieg, CNN"}

Bush's Houston and George W. Bush's Dallas.And some major Bush backers on Sunday even reported being contacted by the team representing Trump, who has made self-funding his campaign one of his premier calling cards and mercilessly taunted Bush as \"low energy\" for the past several months.One Bush bundler contacted by Trump's team told CNN that he was surprised that Trump's aides had beat Rubio's team to the punch. Another financial supporter of Bush heard from a Trump campaign aide on Sunday morning, laying out the reasons why the billionaire will win the nomination and pointing out areas of agreement between the two men.But some fundraisers are still processing that the candidate who had once pledged to assemble a \"shock and awe\" fundraising operation failed to turn any of that support into actual votes. \"I just can't flip a switch and go to the next guy,\" said Jay Zeidman, a Republican bundler from Houston who is anxious for signals from the Bush family about whom to support. \"There are a lot of folks loyal to Jeb and to the family. I just can't imagine them saying, 'I am with Marco'\" immediately.Bush's billionairesIt was right before Christmas 2014 when Bush, who had not been seen as a lock to run for higher office, sent word that he was actively exploring a presidential bid. And as the new year turned, he launched a forceful offensive to secure the loyalty of the Republican Party's most generous patrons -- and it worked.There was New York Jets owner Woody Johnson, who would serve as his national finance chair. Add in Mel Sembler, the Florida developer who helped Mitt Romney raise loads of cash in 2012. And there was former AIG chairman Hank Greenberg, who threw in $10 million to the Bush super PAC, Right to Rise USA, this fall even as Bush struggled in the polls and donors began to worry.All told, Bush's super PAC raised nearly $120 million -- including $100 million raised in the first six months of 2015, when Bush chose to delay his campaign so he could formally coordinate with the big money group. And when he did launch in June, his campaign raised $11.4 million in just about two weeks, a staggering clip that would slow dramatically as his campaign faltered.READ: Jeb's 2016 departure draws out Mike Murphy criticsBush's prowess would soon be outpaced late in the campaign by rivals who assembled similarly strong financial bases. Campaign finance reports released Saturday showed Cruz with more cash on hand than any other Republican, sitting on $13.6million as of the beginning of the month. Cruz even received $2,700 donations in January from Ben Carson's former top adviser, Terry Giles, and from his bitter establishment rival in his 2012 primary, former Texas lieutenant governor David Dewhurst.Trump loaned himself $5 million in January as he continues to largely self-finance his bid. Meanwhile, Kasich and Ben Carson were a few beats behind the rest of the GOP field in the size of their warchests.And even Rubio, who had won over many of the party's most skilled fundraisers as Bush began to struggle last fall, has yet to turn that into a dominant financial position.

They also feel targeted rollouts like the one she made on campus sexual assaults in Iowa earlier this year will help.The gender card is key because it gets at something young voters love: her potential to become the first woman president, said Monmouth University Poll director Patrick Murray. \"One of the things she should probably hit on more is the historic nature of her candidacy,\" Murray said. The disparity can be seen at the campaign's respective rallies. Sanders' supporters, particularly in Iowa and New Hampshire, are generally younger, often with more unruly hair, thick plastic hipster glasses and the occasional waft of patchouli. And Clinton's supporters generally appear a little older and a little more kempt.Nancy Sweetman, a longtime Clinton supporter, first saw Sanders speak at Iowa's Wing Ding dinner in August. After only a few minutes at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, Sweetman said she noticed how much older Clinton supporters were.\"In my lifetime I would like to see a woman that I agree with in the White House,\" said the 71-year old retiree who said she remembers a time when the thought of a woman president was laughable. \"That is a part of it.\" Sanders leads, but will young voters show?Even amid the Clinton campaign's focus on young voters, Sanders, the oldest candidate seeking the White House, has held onto a strong lead among young voters -- a seeming anomaly that makes even a few Sanders aides chuckle.A Des Moines Register poll last week found that Clinton has the support of 64% of Iowa Democrats 65 and older, while Sanders has the support of 58% of people younger than 45. A Fox News poll found similar results in New Hampshire: Sanders wins 59% of people under 45, while Clinton wins 52% of people over than 45.Lynda Tran, a partner at 270 Strategies and a former spokeswoman for President Barack Obama's separate campaign arm --Organizing for America -- said that for Clinton, the best strategy is probably staying the course she's already charted, Tran said.\"The Clinton campaign team in particular has already demonstrated real savvy in their approach, with concerted efforts on everything from Snapchat to Periscope, from college organizing teams to interviews with thought leaders and perceived trendsetters like Lena Dunham,\" she said.READ: Rapper drops Clinton for Sanders But young voters are still less politically engaged than their older counterparts who are far more likely to not only vote in November, but show up at caucus night in Iowa. In 2004, voters 17-to-29 made up 17% of the Iowa Democrats who caucused that year, a dismal turnout of 4%. Even in 2008, where young participation was at an all-time high in Iowa thanks to Obama, only 22% of the electorate was 17-to-29 years old, the same portion of the voters that were 65-and-older.And the Harvard survey reported that only 20% of millennials said they were engaged and fewer than half of the respondents said they were following the 2016 campaign.That, however, won't stopped Clinton from trying.

Bush's mantra was to be the \"joyful\" candidate. But Donald Trump stood in his way. Trump's campaign started as an unexpected sideshow in the eyes of many establishment Republicans. The New Yorker labeled undocumented immigrants \"rapists\" in his announcement speech and boasted that he didn't care to be politically correct. Trump quickly started to gain traction, and within weeks of Bush's announcement, he had taken the lead and run away with it. His surge revealed a Republican electorate that was more angry than joyful. The intensity of these emotions surprised the Washington political class and upended the GOP presidential race. Against this backdrop, Bush increasingly appeared to be a misfit. And it didn't help that Bush often seemed uncomfortable on television and on the debate stage.But at his countless town halls, where Bush was more comfortable and loose, voters routinely walked away surprised at the depth of his knowledge and the energy he showed in person. His campaign briefly hired a media coach, and Bush became more disciplined in his on-camera appearances.Meanwhile his super PAC, Right to Rise USA, trained most of its fire on rivals like Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Ohio Gov. John Kaisch and New Jersey Gov.

The results here will send a powerful signal about who in the GOP field has staying power, as well as the momentum to take on billionaire businessman Donald Trump and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz.Rubio beat Bush on Saturday, helped by the last-minute endorsement of South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley.Former GOP presidential candidate Pat Buchanan, who challenged President George H. W. Bush in the 1992 primaries, said Saturday before the votes came in that a South Carolina rejection of Bush would signal the \"end of the Bush dynasty and the end of Bush Republicanism.\"\"If you add a part of the Cruz vote to the Trump vote, this is a repudiation of everything the Beltway Republican Party has stood for,\" Buchanan told CNN's Michael Smerconish.Bush's campaign in the Palmetto State was an all-hands-on-deck family affair.Former President George W. Bush campaigned for his brother in Greenville on Monday, stepping into the national political spotlight for the first time since leaving the White House in 2009.In a speech heavy on national security, the 43rd president warned voters that the 2016 campaign was a \"serious election for a serious job.\" \"We do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration,\" Bush said, taking a clear swipe at Trump. \"We need someone that can fix the problems that cause our anger and frustration, and that's Jeb Bush.\"Their mother, Barbara Bush, also hit the stump, coming to South Carolina on Thursday and staying through the vote.READ: South Carolina exit polls: Religious voters play large roleSen. Lindsey Graham, who endorsed Bush soon after ending his own White House bid, told fellow South Carolinians this week that Jeb Bush was ready to be commander in chief on day one because he had twice had a \"front row seat\" to the presidency.But even as Bush tried to capitalize on his brother's popularity here and made a strong appeal to the state's large military and veterans communities, his message frequently deviated from his own record as he took aim at Trump. The long-running tensions between the two men reached a new climax last weekend when Trump mocked George W. Bush's legacy at a GOP debate. Bush responded with force, saying that while the real estate developer was busy building a reality TV show, his brother had kept the country safe.\"I'm sick and tired of him going after my family,\" Bush fumed.Bush continued his assault on Trump in campaign stops across the state this past week, painting his competitor as an inexperienced political newcomer full of bluster and anger and lacking leadership experience.But it was clear that Bush's public clashes with the boisterous New Yorker made some of his supporters uncomfortable.When he campaigned at a country club in Summerville this week, of the half-dozen people who took the mic to ask the former governor a question, three directly questioned his strategy.One Bush backer lamented that the campaign had been \"co-opted by the P.T. Barnum of our time\" and that Trump was \"getting you off your message -- your good message.\" 27 photos: Photos: Political families27 photos: Photos: Political familiesPolitical families \u2013 Former Delaware Attorney General Beau Biden embraces his father, Vice President Joe Biden, at the Democratic National Convention in 2008.

But, you know, it's crazy because ... I also think Jeb is a good candidate as well.\" But Ja quickly added that he's a Democrat, \"so yeah, so I would vote Hillary.\"And earlier this month, Clinton won a ringing endorsement from legendary rapper Snoop Dogg, who endorsed Texas Rep. Ron Paul in 2012 due to the Republican's stance on marijuana, before voicing support for Obama.In an interview on Bravo TV, the \"Peaches N Cream\" rapper said \"I'll say that I would love to see a woman in office because I feel like we're at that stage in life to where we need a perspective other than the male's train of thought,\" and added that he will be voting for \"Ms. Clinton.\"Back in 2008, Snoop told Larry King that he was torn between Clinton and Obama but this time around, he is unambiguously backing Clinton.And most recently, the former secretary of state got an enthusiastic endorsement from rapper and actor 50 Cent on Thursday, who had also said that he \"likes Hillary\" back in 2007, during her primary fight with then Sen. Obama.Unlike many celebrities who often have a strong allegiance to the Democratic Party, 50 Cent has expressed support for former President George W. Bush in the past, calling him \"incredible\" and \"a gangsta.\"He also famously defended Bush in 2005 when Kanye West said that \"George Bush doesn't care about black people,\" following the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina. But almost ten years later, the \"In Da Club\" rapper has left no room for ambiguity, proclaiming that \"It's Hillary time\" during an interview with the Daily Beast.The hip-hop star said that having been the First Lady during Bill Clinton's presidency, makes it so that \"Hillary was the president already once.\"\"Some of the things she says feel really comfortable, and roll off. When people are really close with each other, they use each other as soundboards because they're the other person's best friend,\" 50 Cent said, referring to the relationship between Clinton and her husband.Harlem rapper A$AP Rocky said in a recent interview that Clinton is one of \"the best\" and R&B singer Ne-Yo called Clinton \"a favorite of mine.\"Even Beyonc\u00e9, or Queen Bey to her fans, has reportedly attended a Hillary Clinton fundraiser.Some of Clinton's earlier endorsements came from rapper and actor Ice-T, who said in 2012 that Clinton should try running for president again: \"She did the Secretary of State job, she was a G, she held it down, she didn't cry,\" he said, predicting that if she does, Obama will support her.Hip Hop producer and rapper Timbaland, who held a fundraiser for Clinton in 2007, tweeted his support for her last year.Throwback: Bill and Hillary Clinton at my house.

But I know what Hillary represents: She represents a woman in power, and she did great as the Secretary of State. She's gonna win.\"But do these public nods to Clinton from high-profile performers help draw in young supporters to her campaign?\"Getting early endorsements from pop culture figures is always helpful to a campaign to generate interest and enthusiasm,\" said Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons, \"But Secretary Clinton will still have to close the sale with young voters.\"Simmons served as an adviser to P Diddy, during the rappers' Vote or Die campaign, targeting young voters.Republican strategist Kristen Soltis-Anderson, who authored \"Grand Old Party for a Brand New Generation,\" said that while she doesn't think that a significant amount of voters \"actually go to the polls and make a decision in favor of a candidate based on a celebrity endorsement,\" at this stage endorsements draw attention to a candidate.Anderson said that many young people are currently \"checked out of the presidential campaign process,\" so high-profile endorsements \"certainly put a candidate in front of people who might, otherwise, not be paying attention to the race.\"Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Deena Zaru"}

Consovoy, a lawyer for Evenwel, told the justices. \"That question is whether the one person, one vote rule affords eligible voters any reasonable protection,\" he said. He was pressed by Justice Sonia Sotomayor. \"The problem is that what you're forgetting is the dual interest,\" she said. \"There is a voting interest but there is also a representation interest,\" she said. She also questioned the practical consequences of using data that she said had \"almost decisively been proven as being inadequate\" to measure eligible voters. Civil rights groups fear that Latino communities in certain states with nonvoting residents, as well as children and others, would be sharply disadvantaged if the Court were to side with Evenwel. \"Drawing districts to equalize people is the only way to ensure that the communities where people live and work are fairly represented in the nation's legislatures,\" Michael Li, counsel for the Brennan Center's Democracy Program said after oral arguments. Justice Elena Kagan pointed out that when it comes to the apportionment of House members, total population is used as the metric. \"Why would it be the case that the Constitution requires something with respect to one apportionment that it prohibits with respect to another?\" she asked Consovoy. Texas Solicitor General Scott A. Keller argued on behalf of the state, which is defending how the boundaries are drawn. \"Texas validly used federal census data to equalize total population,\" he said, stressing the court should give the states leeway in the area. \"It's our position,\" he said, \"that we could choose a reliable measure of voting-eligible population without running afoul of the Equal Protection Clauses' guarantee against invidious discrimination.\" \"But why is one option exclusive of the other?\" Justice Kennedy -- often a key swing vote -- asked. \"Why can't you have both? You have population equality and voter equality, both, especially when you have indicated that a voter-based apportionment is valid and serves important purposes?\" At one point Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to stress the importance of voters. \"Well, it is called \"one person, one vote,\" that seems to be designed to protect voters,\" he said. Justice Antonin Scalia, another conservative who is normally an active participant at oral arguments, asked no questions.The Obama administration sides mostly with Texas in the dispute, arguing that all states use total population data collected through the federal census. And in briefs supporting Texas, civil rights groups and the Democratic National Committee worry that an adverse ruling might negatively impact those who don't vote. \"To reverse course now is to shun precedent and needlessly engineer a plan to bring harm on a specific subset of people; namely communities of color -- including children -- undocumented individuals and families, persons with prior felony convictions and individuals with disabilities,\" said Penda Hair, co-director of the Advancement Project, in a statement. Also supporting Texas is Nathaniel Persily of Stanford Law School, who says that if the court were to say that the Constitution requires states to use the voting population, it could unleash a series of questions regarding the reliability of voter lists and surveys. \"A national database of eligible voters does not exist and will not exist in the foreseeable future,\" he said in an amicus brief. But Ilya Shapiro of the libertarian Cato Institute says times have changed since the court came down with the one-person, one-vote doctrine and that modern immigration patterns have created disparities in voting districts. He supports Evenwel.\"Just as it was intolerable for a rural district with 500 voters to have the same representation in a state legislature as an urban district with 5,000 voters, it's now constitutionally suspect to have that disparity between a heavily (noncitizen) foreign-born district and one with mostly native-born citizens,\" Shapiro wrote in an essay for Scotusblog. A three-judge district court ruled against Evenwel and dismissed the case.Sign up for CNN Politics' Nightcap newsletter, serving up today's best and tomorrow's essentials in politics.Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "Justices heard oral arguments in a Texas case challenging district lines based on population rather than eligible votersCivil rights groups fear Latino communities in states with many nonvoting residents, as well as children and others, could be sharply disadvantaged", "article_author": "Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court Reporter"}

That is why is it is the hardest job.\" The former secretary of state said she is the \"only candidate on either side with the experience and judgment to keep us safe at home and strong in the world.\"Sanders' campaign has responded to the critiques by questioning Clinton's judgment and noting her 2002 vote for the Iraq War, something that then-Sen. Barack Obama used against her during her failed 2008 campaign.Importance of IowaThe uptick in rhetoric comes in the final days of the Iowa campaign. Democrats will choose who they want as their nominee on February 1 and both external and internal polls show the race is close.Iowa's importance has only increased in recent days, given a string of polls that show Sanders leading in New Hampshire.The former first lady also blasted Sanders plan for single-payer healthcare, casting it as something that would only give Republicans \"an opening to come in and tear down everything we have achieved\" with the Affordable Care Act.\"I know Senator Sanders cares about covering more people, as I do, but rather build on the progress that has been made, he wants to start over from scratch with a whole new system,\" she said.Fire against Sanders was not the only theme of Clinton's speech. The former senator also hit Republicans, as she does regularly, and showed a more contemplative side, something she displayed Wednesday in Burlington, Iowa.\"I can't do any of this alone. I need you,\" Clinton said Thursday during a speech where she acknowledged that she knows \"what it is like to be knocked down.\" \"I have had a few hard times in my own life and I doubt there is anybody who hasn't had their share,\" Clinton said. \"But I learned from my mom and my faith that it is not whether you get knocked down it is whether you get back up.\"Video against Sanders on IranEarlier Thursday, Clinton's campaign released a video where a senior policy aide argues the Vermont senator is unprepared on Iran.Jake Sullivan, Clinton's senior policy adviser and a lead negotiator on the Iran deal, challenges Sanders' call for normalize relations with Iran.\"Secretary Clinton supports diplomacy with Iran. In fact, she helped launch the diplomacy that helped,\" Sullivan says. \"But normal relations with Iran right now? President Obama doesn't support that idea. Secretary Clinton doesn't support that idea. And it's not at all clear why it is that Sen. Sanders is suggesting it.\"After listing some of Sanders' foreign policy ideas, Sullivan said, \"When you look at all of these ideas, it's pretty clear that he just hasn't thought it through.\"At Sunday's debate, Sanders said it was time for the United States to \"move as aggressively as we can to normalize relations with Iran, understanding that Iran's behavior in so many ways in something that we disagree with.\"\"Their support for terrorism, the anti-American rhetoric that we're hearing from some of their leadership is something that is unacceptable,\" Sanders said. \"On the other hand, the fact that we managed to reach an agreement, something that I very strongly supported, that prevents Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and that we did that without going to war and that I believe we're seeing a thaw in our relations with Iran is a very positive step.\"And on Tuesday, Clinton's campaign released a joint statement from 10 former Obama and Clinton administration diplomats who are questioning Bernie Sanders' ability to handle foreign policy issues, including working with Iran and fighting ISIS.", "article_highlights": "Clinton delivered a blistering assessment of Bernie Sanders' credentials and readiness to be PresidentClinton's campaign also released a video where a senior policy aide argues the Vermont senator \"just hasn't thought it through\" on IranPart of the speech will be used in an ad as well", "article_author": "Jeff Zeleny and Dan Merica, CNN"}

The notion of losing the primary to Sanders or Martin O'Malley, the former Maryland governor, is not even discussed privately among her strategists. Even after seeing the raucous and passionate weekend crowd for Sanders, her advisers believe the only question facing Clinton is how long the nominating fight could last.The uncertainty in the Republican contest makes the Democratic primary look even more stable.Yet Clinton advisers bristle at any notion that her candidacy could become a coronation. They know such arguments would further inflame supporters of Sanders.He escalated his argument against Clinton in Iowa, suggesting she is a finger-to-the-wind politician and not a principled one.

Interviews with a dozen O'Malley backers at the Iowa dinner found 11 who told CNN they would support Clinton if O'Malley dropped out of the race or wasn't viable in the Iowa caucuses on February 1. A voter's second choice is important in the Democratic caucuses: If a candidate falls short of 15% in every precinct, voters must pick an alternative.\"Hillary, I really believe, has the integrity, the experience to be president,\" said Sharon Acuff, 68, a retiree who was at the dinner to support O'Malley, but is open to Clinton. \"After hearing her for 11 and a half hours being drilled, I think she handled it very well.\"In conversations with voters over the weekend in Iowa, the Benghazi hearing was repeatedly mentioned as a positive turning point in how they viewed Clinton.\"I just like a lot of what she stands for,\" said Maria Downs, 51, an insurance adjuster who is supporting O'Malley but feels warmly toward Clinton. \"I think we need a woman leader. I think she is strong and she showed that by sitting before a panel for so many hours and keeping her cool.\"RELATED: Bernie Sanders says he's not shouting at ClintonFor all the accolades Clinton has received, multiple obstacles remain.The FBI is still investigating her private email server she used as Secretary of State. She has struggled to tap into the liberal populist enthusiasm to the same degree as Sanders, who has overwhelmed her on several fronts, ranging from online fundraising to crowd counts.Still, there is little question Clinton has turned a corner -- even if only a psychological one after enduring one controversy after another this summer. But her 2008 loss to Barack Obama is a reminder for longtime supporters to take nothing for granted.\"We had two good weeks, yes,\" said Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign communications director, working to calibrate expectations. \"But it doesn't mean from here on out that everything will be easy. It is going to be really hard to get the Democratic nomination.\"Bill Clinton, who made a rare appearance on the campaign trail in Iowa, is expected to increase his visibility in the campaign. He and others are sending the message, several Democrats say, that it will soon be time to fall in line behind her.Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, a longtime confidant and cheerleader of the Clinton family, said the testimony at the Benghazi committee showcased Clinton's experience and presidential timber like nothing else could have. But he said it was far too early to take a victory lap.\"Who wants to be presumptuous here?\" McAuliffe told CNN. \"We've got a long way to go.\"Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Jeff Zeleny and Dan Merica, CNN"}

Some previous secretaries of state -- including Colin Powell -- have also used private email accounts, but Clinton's approach was particularly controversial because it's out of step with typical government practice now and gave Clinton a major measure of control over what remains private and what's public. Clinton's lawyers turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department, and the department has since processed those -- releasing some, under a judge's orders, at the end of each month. But she didn't hand in the server itself until last month, after five months of intense scrutiny over whether she flouted transparency laws or put government secrets at risk. Why did she do it?Clinton has chalked it all up to convenience, saying she preferred not to carry two phones -- one with a personal email address and one with a work email. There's some legitimacy to that: Government BlackBerrys could only include one address. But having her own personal server also gave Clinton -- as well as her closest aides -- much greater control over which emails were accessible under public records requests. Clinton acknowledged, both in March when her private email use was first reported and again in Iowa last month, that it \"clearly wasn't the best choice\" to skip using a government email address. What's in the emails?It's mostly innocuous -- with Clinton asking for scheduling updates, fitting in trips to her hair stylist, checking on a strange trade dispute over gefilte fish and receiving notes about the balance of a career and a family from a top policy aide.But the emails also offer insight into Clinton's closest contacts. Among them: Sidney Blumenthal, who sent what Clinton has said were unsolicited -- yet were clearly warmly received -- notes with advice and guidance on domestic and international politics. Many of the emails are, in part or in full, redacted. That makes it tough to tell what behind-the-scenes policy conversations were taking place as Clinton navigated tricky international waters. Of the 7,000 emails released by the State Department this week, 125 were retroactively classified. Did Clinton break the rules? There are laws intended to keep government records transparent -- but one that requires officials to transfer emails sent to private addresses onto government servers wasn't enacted until 2014, after Clinton departed the State Department. Still, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan suggested last month that Clinton violated government policy and made the process of responding to open records requests more difficult. \"We wouldn't be here today if this employee had followed government policy,\" he said at a hearing on one of the dozens of lawsuits over Clinton's emails. Looming larger is the question of how classified information was handled -- the subject of a Justice Department investigation and the question that ultimately forced Clinton to turn over her private server to the FBI. Clinton has insisted she never sent or received information that was classified at the time -- though many of her emails have been classified retroactively as the State Department has prepared them for release. Was what she did illegal? Probably not, said Anne M. Tomkins, the former U.S. attorney who oversaw the prosecution of Gen. David Petraeus over his having showed classified materials to his mistress and biographer. Tomkins wrote this week in USA Today that Clinton committed no crime because she didn't \"knowingly\" share classified materials. \"Clinton is not being investigated for knowingly sending or receiving classified materials improperly,\" Tomkins wrote. \"Indeed, the State Department has confirmed that none of the information that has surfaced on Clinton's server thus far was classified at the time it was sent or received,\" she wrote. \"Additionally, the Justice Department indicated that its inquiry is not a criminal one and that Clinton is not the subject of the inquiry.\"What's classified, when was it made classified and why? All government agencies are responsible for determining which of their own materials are classified. But Clinton's emails are being reviewed by a team of about 12 interagency officials, who are making recommendations on what should and shouldn't be classified. State Department spokesman John Kirby told reporters in August that \"there's an exhaustive, extensive review process for each and every email, which includes not just State Department reviewers going through them but having intelligence community reviewers with us at the time as we go through them in real-time to help make determinations.\"Kirby added, \"Some of those determinations are fairly easy -- yes or no. Some of them require additional review and discussion.\" What's next? What does this have to do with Congress? Are there lawsuits over the emails?It's not just the State Department's email releases forcing fresh headlines about the issue. The House's Benghazi committee chaired by Rep. Trey Gowdy is calling two top Clinton aides in for closed-door depositions this week. Cheryl Mills, Clinton's State Department chief of staff, will appear Thursday, while policy adviser Jake Sullivan is expected Friday. Another former State Department employee Bryan Pagliano who worked on Clinton's private email server has informed Congress that he will invoke the Fifth Amendment to avoid testifying before the House Select Committee.Clinton herself will appear before the committee for an open hearing -- one likely to attract the most television cameras of any congressional hearing in recent memory -- on Oct. 22. There are also dozens of lawsuits seeking Clinton's emails. They range from news organizations like Gawker and The Associated Press to conservative groups like Judicial Watch. The State Department said Tuesday that it will ask for all of those lawsuits to be consolidated under a single judge.What's it mean for 2016?Among Clinton's biggest challenges in the presidential race is demonstrating her authenticity -- and part of that is showing voters she's trustworthy. Increasingly, though, voters say they distrust Clinton. The numbers have shifted dramatically since news of her private email server was first reported in March. Her campaign has shifted tactics in recent weeks, dropping the jokes Clinton had cracked about what she'd once portrayed as a non-issue and sending aides out in an attempt to diffuse the issue in television appearances -- signaling that it's an increasingly serious challenge.

About 56% say so in the new poll, up from 51% in March. About 4-in-10 (39%) now say she did not do anything wrong by using personal email. Among Democrats, the share saying she did not do anything wrong has dipped from 71% in March to 63% now, and just 37% of independents say she did not do wrong by using the personal email system. And positive impressions of Clinton continue to fade. Among all adults, the new poll finds 44% hold a favorable view of her, 53% an unfavorable one, her most negative favorability rating since March 2001. A majority of women voters have a positive take on Clinton, 52% view her favorably, and her support among women appears to be the foundation for her general election advantages.But the fading numbers haven't hurt her against some GOP contenders. Clinton has her biggest lead over Fiorina, topping her 53% to 43% among registered voters. She leads Bush by a nearly identical margin, 52% to 43%. And Clinton tops both Trump (51% to 45%) and Walker (52% to 46%) by 6 points each.All of those leads are boosted by sizable gender gaps. Against Bush, Clinton leads 59% to 37% among women, while Bush holds an advantage among men, 51% Bush to 44% Clinton. Against Fiorina, the only woman among the major candidates for the Republican Party's presidential nominations, women break 60% for Clinton to 39% for Fiorina, while men are about evenly divided, 48% for Fiorina, 46% for Clinton. The largest gender gap -- 34 points -- comes in a match-up between Clinton and Trump. Women favor Clinton by 23 points, 60% to 37%, while men break in Trump's favor by 11 points, 53% to 42%.At the same time, Clinton's lead in the race for the Democratic nomination for president is narrowing, and the new poll suggests the best way for the former secretary of state to shift the momentum would be for Vice President Joe Biden to decide to sit this one out. Most Democrats, though, say they'd like to see Biden make a run for the White House.RELATED: Political odd couple: Ivanka Trump and Chelsea ClintonOverall, 47% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters say they support Clinton for the party's nomination. That's down 9 points since July, and marks the first time her support has dipped below 50% in national CNN/ORC polling on the race. At the same time, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has climbed 10 points since July and holds second place in the race with 29%. Biden follows at 14%, former MarylandGov. Martin O'Malley is at 2%, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb has 1% and less than 1% back former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee.And though support for Clinton's nomination bid has slipped, she is the candidate most trusted by Democrats on four top issues, and remains the candidate to beat in general election match-ups.Should Biden decide not to make a run for the presidency, his supporters would largely flock to Clinton rather than Sanders, boosting her numbers. With Biden's backers re-allocated to their second choice, Clinton holds 56%, Sanders 33%, with support for O'Malley, Webb and Chafee unchanged.Among those Democratic voters who are \"extremely enthusiastic\" about voting for president next year, it's already essentially a two-person race. Clinton is the choice of 50% of such voters, with Sanders jumping to 38% among that group, Biden at 6%, and O'Malley at 2%.Still, most Democrats say they do want Biden to make a go of it: 53% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters say they think Biden should run, 45% that he should stay out. Even among those who currently support Clinton, 50% say they think Biden should run. RELATED: Post-debate, Trump pulls clear of competitionDemocratic voters aren't necessarily convinced a Biden presidency would be better than a Clinton one, though: 35% say Biden would do a worse job as president than Clinton, 27% a better one and 38% say there wouldn't be any difference between the two. Those who think Biden should run are more apt to say he'd do a better job than a worse one (41% better vs. 18% worse) but a sizable 41% say there ultimately wouldn't be any difference between the two.Fewer see Sanders as equivalent to Clinton, more say he'd do a worse job. Overall, 37% of Democratic voters think Sanders would do a worse job as president than Clinton, 31% that he'd do a better job, and 29% that there would be no difference between the two. That shifts among the party's liberal voters, 41% of whom think Sanders would do a better job than Clinton, 34% think he would do worse than Clinton and 22% that there would be no difference.Sanders has boosted his favorability rating in the last month, 35% of adults and 58% of Democratic voters have a positive impression of the senator, that's up from 23% among adults and 36% among Democratic voters since July.When Democratic voters are asked which candidate they trust to handle the economy, race relations, foreign policy and the income gap between rich and poor Americans, Clinton tops the list each time. Her biggest advantage comes on foreign policy, where 61% of registered Democrats say they trust Clinton over the rest of the field. Biden follows at 22%, and just 9% say Sanders is their top choice here. On the economy, 45% say Clinton would best handle it, 26% choose Sanders and 21% Biden.50 photos: Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlightFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pictured here on Tuesday, March 3, has become one of the most powerful people in Washington.

His losses to Cruz in Maine -- where Gov. Paul LePage had endorsed him -- and Kansas give hope to other campaigns that a strong ground game can at least chip away at his delegate count.Cruz's two victories over Trump on Saturday came as Republicans turned up the heat on the real estate mogul this week. On Thursday, former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney delivered a blistering speech in Utah decrying Trump's campaign, and a number of high-profile members of the national security community expressed concern about his lack of understanding of foreign affairs. The outcome could encourage them to keep searching for vulnerabilities to exploit.JUST WATCHEDThe delegate math it would take to stop Trump ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe delegate math it would take to stop Trump02:20RELATED: How Super Saturday unfoldedTrump also took criticism from conservatives for skipping a scheduled appearance at the Conservative Political Action Conference, the largest annual gathering of right-wing activists. Instead of addressing the conference, Trump held a rally in Kansas, a state Texas Sen. Cruz won Saturday by a margin of two-to-one.However, Trump's campaign demonstrated strength in the South, a region Cruz's campaign had pointed to as key to its strategy earlier in the race. Trump on Saturday won the caucuses in Kentucky and the delegate-rich primary in Louisiana.In his remarks after results were announced, Trump took the opportunity to knock both Cruz and Rubio. He called on Rubio, a Florida senator, to drop out of the race before the all-important Florida primary March 15, and he even worked a dig into his explanation of Cruz's victory, making a reference to the Texas senator's country of birth: \"He should do well in Maine, because it's very close to Canada.\"2. Cruz builds his caseCruz has defeated Trump in more state contests than any other competitor, and in regions as diverse as the South, Midwest and New England. The showing bolsters his argument that he's the only figure in the GOP who can take on the billionaire businessman.JUST WATCHEDSen. Ted Cruz: 'God bless Kansas'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSen. Ted Cruz: 'God bless Kansas' 01:11It's a point Cruz made at a campaign event in Idaho Saturday, where he telegraphed that other candidates should drop out to let Republicans rally around him: \"What we are seeing in Kansas is a manifestation of a real shift in momentum.\"Cruz benefitted from the fact that three of the four contests on Saturday were caucuses and that only one allowed voters other than previously registered Republicans to participate. These types of votes play to his strong ground organization and his appeal to the more committed, conservative wing of the party.Underscoring his appeal among this group, Cruz on Saturday also won a straw poll of staunchly conservative activists gathered for the Conservative Political Action Conference, a sign that the ideological right seems to be rallying around him. Despite his strong showing on Saturday, Cruz still faces major hurdles in overcoming Trump in the delegate race. Future contests include a mix of primaries and caucuses, many of which are open to voters who are not already registered Republicans. Cruz will need a better performance in those \"open\" states than he has had in the past if he wants to win.3. Sanders still a thorn in Clinton's sideAfter Saturday, Clinton still won't be able to shut Sanders out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, even though she pulled in another win Saturday and leads the delegate count.The Vermont senator continues to pick up just enough victories around the country -- he took Nebraska and Kansas on Saturday -- to stay a relevant force. And his campaign war chest remains strong enough to push him forward, possibly for months.JUST WATCHEDBernie Sanders blasts Hillary Clinton's Wall Street tiesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBernie Sanders blasts Hillary Clinton's Wall Street ties 01:36In a statement after he won Nebraska, Sanders hammered this point home, saying it was contests like this one that will help propel his campaign into the summer.\"The win in Nebraska coupled with a double-digit victory in Kansas tonight will put us on a path toward victory. We've got the momentum, the energy and the excitement that will take us all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia,\" Sanders said.In a way, Sanders is doing the same thing to Clinton now that she did to then-Sen. Barack Obama in the 2008 race. Even though Obama was racking up more delegate wins with each vote, Clinton still had the support and donor firepower to keep the race going.Now, Clinton will need to carry a string of states to prove she has the Democratic race locked down. And it will be hard for her to argue Sanders should bow out any time soon, since she resisted dropping out in 2008 even as the math turned more and more against her.4. Clinton still wins more diverse statesSanders's campaign tends to do better in states with large populations of white voters, while the former secretary of state has had more success in states where greater numbers of African-Americans participate. That trend continued Saturday, when Sanders won in Nebraska and Kansas, two states where more than 85% of the population is white.JUST WATCHEDHillary Clinton wins Louisiana Democratic primaryReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHillary Clinton wins Louisiana Democratic primary 01:28Clinton, meanwhile, crushed Sanders in Louisiana, where more than 30% of the population is African-American.The results will help bolster the Clinton campaign's insistence that there could be a cap on Sanders' ability to garner support as the race extends to other parts of the country.Sanders has acknowledged that his campaign does poorly among Southern black voters but also projects confidence that he will do better.\"We got decimated,\" Sanders said on ABC's \"This Week\" of South Carolina, where Clinton beat him 74% to 26% last month.But Sanders predicted that he would do much better with African-American voters outside the Deep South: \"You're going to see us much better in New York state, where I think we have a shot to win, in California and in Michigan.\"Sanders will have a chance to prove he's right very soon, as the campaigns head north to Michigan, Illinois and Ohio in the next 10 days.5. Rubio and Kasich can't wait to go homeWhile Trump and Cruz both claimed victories Saturday, Rubio and Kasich, the governor of Ohio, played only a minor role in the four states that participated.Both are relying heavily on upcoming contests in their home states -- Rubio in Florida and Kasich in Ohio -- on March 15. If they don't win at home, it's hard to see how either proceeds in this race.Florida and Ohio are both big, winner-take-all states, so victories in both of those states would make it more difficult for Trump to secure the delegates he needs to clinch the nomination.JUST WATCHEDKasich predicts Ohio win and contested conventionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHKasich predicts Ohio win and contested convention 05:32But Saturday's results certainly don't give either of them increased momentum going into their March 15 home-field contests. And to the extent that Rubio's harsh attacks on Trump last week, particularly at the Fox News debate on Thursday night, played into Saturday's results, they seemed to have helped Cruz more than anyone.RELATED: Super Saturday: Big night for Cruz; Clinton, Trump take LouisianaRubio downplayed the Saturday results during a press conference in Puerto Rico, where he is making a play for the U.S. territory's 23 delegates, to be doled out Sunday.\"There will be more delegates awarded in Florida than basically any other state that voted tonight combined,\" Rubio said. \"There are clearly states in which some of my opponents do better than us because it fits the profile they've targeted. We understood that.\"Rubio's campaign pointed to upcoming states on the electoral calendar, particularly the fact that there are only two states left that hold caucuses. His team believes he will do better in primaries, though so far he has only won one contest -- in Minnesota -- which was a caucus.But primaries are also likely to benefit Trump, which has been more successful under that system than caucuses.", "article_highlights": "Cruz's two victories over Trump on Saturday came as Republicans turned up the heat on the real estate mogulClinton still won't be able to shut Sanders out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination", "article_author": "Chris Moody"}

However, some incarceration experts say that it is unfair to compare Seychelles, with a population of about 90,000, to the United States, a country with more than 300 million people.

The bill did indeed involve a $16.3 billion overhaul of the department.The bill called for the building of more VA medical facilities, the hiring of more doctors and nurses, increased funding to allow some veterans can get health care in private facilities, and also made it easier to fire or otherwise discipline senior VA officials.Soon after the bill's passage, McCain, a Vietnam veteran and former prisoner of war, told The Hill newspaper that Sanders \"does have a record of advocacy for our veterans.\"The bill did involve a $16.3 billion overhaul.Verdict: True.Reality Check: Sanders says he's never run a negative adBy Tami Luhby and Tom LoBianco, CNNSanders said he's never run a negative ad. Throughout his campaign, he has pledged not to make personal attacks on Clinton.\"I have never run a negative ad in my life and I look forward to never running a negative ad in my life,\" he said.But over the course of a sharp-elbowed campaign against Clinton, Sanders has walked right up to the line of what counts for a \"negative ad\" and possibly crossed it, depending on how it's viewed.In mid-January, Sanders began talking more and more about the hundreds of thousands of dollars Clinton had received in speaking fees from Goldman Sachs at his rallies -- a clear tactic to exploit one of her greatest weaknesses as the race tightened in Iowa.JUST WATCHEDSanders: Clinton can't be 'moderate' and 'progressive'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSanders: Clinton can't be 'moderate' and 'progressive' 01:24Then, a little more than a week before the Iowa caucuses, in an ad that was a broadside against Wall Street, the Sanders campaign fashioned that talking point into a brief line in the spot.In his \"Two Visions\" ad, Sanders says there are \"two Democratic visions for regulating Wall Street.\" One vision, Sanders relays, \"says it is OK to take millions from big banks and then tell him what to do.\" The second option is Sanders' plan to break up big banks, close tax loopholes and make the wealthy \"pay their fair share.\"Clinton is never mentioned by name in the ad, but it's clear that she is the target.In December, the Sanders campaign abruptly pulled an internet ad that highlighted ties between Clinton and financial institutions, according to The Washington Post. A Sanders spokesman told the Post that the ad appeared due to \"a miscommunication in our communications shop.\"Clinton and her supporters have said that the ad is one piece in one of the most negative campaigns run by a Democrat. Sanders and his team say that a negative ad only consists of personal attacks, and that any talk of Goldman Sachs fees counts as a \"contrast ad\" on the issues.Sanders carefully parsed his language to say he hasn't engaged in a negative \"ad.\"Sanders has certainly injected negativity into the campaign. He hasn't been shy about going hard after Clinton on her speaking fees and a whole range of items on the trail and in social media.Here's an example: A tweet posted from his presidential campaign Twitter account two hours before the town hall listed more than two dozen of Clinton's failings, including having a Wall Street-funded super PAC and supporting the invasion of Iraq.Verdict: True, but misleading.Hillary ClintonReality Check: Clinton on Johnson Controls 'inversion' By Chip Grabow, CNN Many voters feel former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton represents the interests of corporate America, moderator Anderson Cooper told the Democratic candidate on Wednesday. Clinton denied the characterization, citing that many Wall Street interests were funding other candidates in an effort to defeat her.She called it a \"strange argument\" since she made various efforts as senator of New York to crack down on Wall Street, from calling them out she said on changes to CEO pay to mortgage issues and calling for a consumer financial protection bureau.She went further, saying: \"I'm not just going after Wall Street, though. I think that's too narrow a target. I think we need to go after a company like Johnson Controls that is trying to avoid paying taxes after all of us bailed it out by pretending to sell itself in a so-called inversion in Europe. It's a perversion. It should be stopped.\"Listen to the full Town Hall with Hillary ClintonShe was referring to a Milwaukee-based auto parts maker. That company benefited from the 2008 bailout of the automotive industry by the federal government. But Clinton also was referring to a more recent event, Johnson Controls' agreement last week to merge with Ireland-based manufacturer, Tyco Controls. The sale to an overseas company allows Johnson to reduce its U.S. tax obligation by $150 million, according to the New York Times. That corporate maneuver is known as a tax inversion.Our verdict on Clinton's characterization of Johnson Controls' avoiding having to pay taxes in the U.S. is true.Reality Check: Clinton on former secretaries of state delivering paid speechesBy Kevin Liptak, CNNClinton, a former secretary of state, defended herself against claims of cashing in on her government job by suggesting her predecessors followed the same practice.\"I made speeches to lots of groups,\" Clinton said. \"Every secretary of state that I know has done that.\"Clinton is right that former top diplomats are all charging premium rates for imparting their wisdom upon paying audiences. Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright are all listed as speakers-for-hire on the website of Washington Speakers Bureau, an agency that helps organizations book top speaking talent.What differs between those former secretaries of state and Clinton is the paychecks they're able to pull in.JUST WATCHEDHillary Clinton shrugs off Goldman Sachs speaking feesReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHillary Clinton shrugs off Goldman Sachs speaking fees 01:40Rice, who served as top diplomat in President George W. Bush's second term, earned a $150,000 payday for a speech at the University of Minnesota in 2014, the Minnesota Daily reported at the time.Her predecessor, Powell, earns similar amounts for his appearances, raking in between $100,000 to $200,000 per speech, according to Bloomberg Businessweek.Albright, President Bill Clinton's envoy in his second term, earns in the five-figure range, according to booking sources who spoke to The New York Times in July.Meanwhile, Clinton's financial disclosure forms show she earned more than $300,000 for her top-paid speeches. The oft-cited figure of $675,000 for remarks to Goldman Sachs was payment for three speeches delivered in different states.Clinton's claim that she isn't alone in earning money on the speaking circuit holds up, but, as one of the country's most famous women, she earns substantially more per speech than her predecessors at the State Department.Verdict: True, but given the amounts, misleading.Reality Check: Clinton on Iraq War voteBy Ryan Browne, CNNWhen asked about her 2002 Senate vote that authorized military action in Iraq, Clinton said she regretted the vote but at the time thought it would help compel Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein's government to allow the U.N. to continue inspections for possible weapons of mass destruction.Clinton said: \"The very explicit appeal that President Bush made before announcing the invasion that getting that vote would be a strong piece of leverage in order to finish the inspections. And he made that comment. And the U.N. inspector, Hans Blix, said give us the time, we will find out, give us the hammer over their head, namely the vote, and we will be able to find out what they still have in terms of (weapons of mass destruction).\"JUST WATCHEDClinton: I'm a progressive who likes to get things doneReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHClinton: I'm a progressive who likes to get things done 01:26While Clinton during the time of the vote did say that it was not a vote for unilateralism, the then-senator from New York opted to vote against an amendment to the resolution that would have stressed a U.N.-centric approach.The amendment by Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, would have limited U.S. military action to enforcing a new U.N. resolution to eliminate Iraq's nuclear, biological and chemical weapons programs. If the United Nations did not act, Congress would immediately be convened so the president could seek a second vote to move against Iraq without U.N. support.Blix, who was the U.N. chief weapons inspector at the time, never voiced support for a unilateral military authorization in Iraq. While speaking to the U.K. Iraq War inquiry in 2010, Blix acknowledged the pressure of the U.S. military buildup in the region had led Saddam to permit U.N. inspectors to return in September 2002.However, Blix also said that he did not believe the U.S. was entitled to invade Iraq without a U.N. Security Council resolution specifically authorizing military action.Clinton's statement seems to suggest that Blix requested the Senate vote to aid inspections. There appears to be no evidence of this.Verdict: False.Reality Check: Clinton on the auto bailoutBy: Kate Grise and Emma Lacey-Bordeaux, CNNClinton sung the praises of President Barack Obama's bailout of the auto industry, saying, \"All of us paid for it. They paid back the Treasury. We didn't lose any money and we saved a lot of jobs.\"When the Treasury Department closed the books on the $45.9 billion bailout, taxpayers had lost $10.6 billion.General Motors did repay everything it was obligated to pay back, but because the administration chose to buy GM stock rather than give it a loan during the bailout, taxpayers got the short end of the stick. GM stock was never profitable enough to recoup all of the investment.JUST WATCHEDHow Hillary Clinton plans to reach young votersReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHow Hillary Clinton plans to reach young voters 01:39Taxpayers also lost about $1.3 billion on the bailout of Chrysler Group.Those losses, however, may have been a bargain in the long run. If the two automakers had gone out of business, it would have cut taxes collected from automakers, their suppliers and dealers. Unemployment benefits would have needed to be paid to 1.5 million workers out of a job and they would have been paying less in personal taxes. Overall, the Center for Automotive Research estimates that all of those losses could have cost the federal government up to about $50 billion to $60 billion in the first year and another $34 billion to $54 billion in the second year.The Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank, also estimates that the bailout saved 1.5 million U.S. jobs by keeping GM, Chrysler and the companies that depended on them in business.We rate Clinton's claim that taxpayers didn't lose any money as false because the Treasury did not recoup its full investment in either automaker, but her claim that the bailout saved \"a lot\" of jobs as true.Reality Check: Clinton on drug overdose deaths in New HampshireBy Lisa Rose, CNNAfter taking a question on the topic of medical marijuana, Clinton expressed concern about substance abuse in New Hampshire. She said drug overdoses are a leading cause of death in the state, adding, \"There have been more deaths by overdoses than car crashes.\"Clinton is correct in that assessment, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.JUST WATCHEDHillary Clinton weighs in on marijuana, drugsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHillary Clinton weighs in on marijuana, drugs 03:15In 2014, 334 people died of drug overdoses in New Hampshire, according to the CDC.There were 95 traffic fatalities in New Hampshire the same year, according to the NHTSA.Although it's questionable to conflate the topics of medical marijuana and opioid addiction, Clinton's numbers are on the mark. We rate her claim true.Reality Check: Clinton's campaign donors are mostly womenBy Sonam Vashi, CNNClinton touted her individual campaign contributions, saying, \"I'm proud to have 90% of my donations from small donors and 60%, the highest ever, from women, which I'm really, really glad about.\"Clinton is vague in the first part of her statement, leaving open the possibility that she's talking about 90% of the number of donations rather than 90% of the total amount she's raised.In her most recent filings released Sunday, which reflects the end of 2015, the Clinton campaign reported that 94% of the number of donations to her campaign were in increments of $100 or less.However, as a percentage of money raised, about $9 million, or 24% of the money raised in the last quarter, were from donations of $200 or less.That percentage is close to what the Federal Election Commission shows of the total amount given to Clinton in this campaign cycle: donations of $200 or less were 28.5 million, or 25%, of the total amount of money her campaign has raised. For comparison, the FEC also shows that the same small donations to Sanders were 62.8 million, or 85%, of the total amount his campaign has raised.So, as a percentage of contributors, the 90% that she cited is true. But looking at percentage of money raised, small contributors gave only 24% of the total raised. If we include that calculation, we must rate her claim as true, but misleading, since her campaign is mostly funded by large donors.For the last quarter, the Clinton campaign also reported that more than 60% of its donations were from women.Currently, Clinton's large donor breakdown by gender is 53%, according to the Center for Responsive Politics -- but that percentage only includes those who have given $200 or more, not small donors. In the reporting period ending in September 2015, women also made up 60% of Clinton's donors. However, in that same period, Sanders' campaign claimed that more women had donated to the Vermont senator than to Clinton (more than 300,000 women to about 240,000, respectively). We rate her 60% claim to be true.", "article_highlights": "The Democratic candidates for president gathered in New Hampshire for CNN's Democratic Town Hall on WednesdayThe team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the event and selected key statements, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated", "article_author": "CNN's Reality Check Team"}

Sanders, having voted against the war in Iraq, keeps reminding everyone about the differences between his vote and Clinton's. And he uses Clinton's Goldman Sachs speeches as a concrete sign of her connections to Wall Street.Sanders: Clinton is 'funded by Wall Street'Sanders' outreach a work in progressThe primary battle is now on friendly terrain for Sanders: a state that's overwhelmingly white and liberal. But it will soon shift west, to Latino-heavy Nevada, and south, to largely African-American South Carolina. Clinton has a huge advantage among those voters -- and Sanders is still working to broaden his appeal, to explain his idea of \"democratic socialism\" and to get comfortable reaching out to specific populations.Asked about police brutality and racial injustice, Sanders said it's \"an important question that is on the minds of millions of people, not just African-Americans, but -- but all people.\" And on religion, Sanders said that yes, he has strong religious and spiritual feelings, but rather than talking about faith he steered the conversation back to action and his campaign's economic themes. \"I believe that, as a human being, the pain that one person feels, if we have children who are hungry in America, if we have elderly people who can't afford their prescription drugs, you know what, that impacts you, that impacts me,\" he said. \"And I worry very much about a society where some people spiritually say, it doesn't matter to me, I got it, I don't care about other people. So my spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me.That's my very strong spiritual feeling. \"Clinton, Sanders clash over what it means to be progressiveClinton's youth problemClinton knows she needs to cut into Sanders' massive advantage among young voters. And she got off to a good start Wednesday night, crediting \"the level, the intensity, of commitment of this generation\" on combating racism, sexism, homophobia, economic injustice and climate change. She needled young voters the same way she'd privately told Black Lives Matter protesters, in a meeting videotaped and later released, that it wasn't enough to change hearts -- they needed to change policy. \"I'm impressed with them, and I'm going to do everything I can to reach out and explain why good ideas on paper are important, but you've got to be able to translate that into action,\" Clinton said.\"Here's what I want young people to know: They don't have to be for me. I'm going to be for them,\" she added.But the very next question demonstrated why reaching those young people is so hard for Clinton.Cooper asked: \"What's wrong with a revolution?\"And Clinton began her answer: \"That's for Senator Sanders to explain.\" What she said was that Democrats' progress on issues like health care was \"hard fought for, hard won and must be defended.\"What she meant came later in the evening, when she told a mother she wanted her 20-something daughters to press her on how she'd get her policy proposals past hurdles like a 60-vote filibuster in the Senate.\"It's very hard to see how any of his proposals could ever be achievable,\" Clinton said of Sanders.Clinton campaign wants you to know she is losing in New HampshireOppo book opens on SandersSanders often touts his tenure as the Senate's veterans committee chairman -- but along with that comes some baggage, such as the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs.When CNN's Anderson Cooper asked about the 18 inspector general reports detailing problems there, Sanders had to explain why those shortcomings weren't addressed on his watch.\"Well, a fair question. And I think you know the answer is that we have worked on many, many issues, Anderson. And your point is fair that we should've acted sooner,\" he said. \"We should've known what was going on in Phoenix, those long waiting lines and the lies that some administrators were telling us.\" Sanders touted the panel's work helping homeless veterans and passing a bill providing college tuition for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.But his admission that he missed deficiencies at the agency offered a look at a challenge for Sanders that will likely loom larger as his campaign grows stronger. Clinton hasn't hit him yet for it, and likely won't in New Hampshire, where polls show him with a large enough lead that she could look desperate unleashing a new assault.Still, it's evidence there's more material in the opposition research book to use against Sanders. The more it's deployed, the worse he could fare in the head-to-head matchups with Republicans that he so often cites. Clinton's classroomClinton is at her best when she's fielding wonky or philosophical questions with room to explain herself. And twice Wednesday night, she comfortably embraced the role of professor, and turned the town hall into her classroom.First came a question from a man who is suffering from terminal colon cancer, about assisted suicide.\"This is the first time I've been asked that question,\" Clinton said.But she dove into the ethical challenges facing medical professionals confronting the issue, and said with end-of-life treatment improving and human lives lasting longer, she's eager to read more about the ethics, science and religion of it.She even pointed to a country she'll use as a case study: the Netherlands.JUST WATCHEDHillary Clinton: It's hard for me to talk about myselfReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHillary Clinton: It's hard for me to talk about myself 03:00Later, Clinton was asked by a rabbi how she stays humble while possessing the ego necessary in presidential politics -- potentially a tough question, but one she sounded eager to answer.Clinton cited Catholic priest Henri Nouwen's book \"The Return of the Prodigal Son.\" \"It basically is practice the discipline of gratitude,\" she said, explaining that limitations necessitate reaching out to more people, that critics should be heard. \"But at the end, be grateful. Practice the discipline of gratitude,\" she said. \"And that has helped me enormously.\"Fact-checking the candidates' claimsBernie's rearview mirror Sanders doesn't like to talk about himself much. And really, as a candidate vying to lead a forward-looking \"revolution,\" he doesn't have to. But when he does, it works.The 74-year-old answered a question about his age by playing up his high school days as a distance runner.He talked, a bit awkwardly, about his car, which he said is red and \"about five years old.\"\"I have a small Chevrolet. It is one of the smallest Chevys that they make,\" he said. Can he do an impersonation of Larry David, who nails Sanders on \"Saturday Night Live\": \"I am Larry David. And you didn't get it,\" Sanders shot back. And asked about the time he was arrested while protesting for the desegregation of schools as a student at the University of Chicago, Sanders described how he got interested in politics in the first place.\"Like in any school you see big kids picking on little kids, you know,\" he said. \"And I resented that. I always did.\" Opinion: Why Clinton, not Sanders, 'won' the town hall", "article_highlights": "Clinton continues to struggle with her answers to questions on Iraq and collecting hundreds of thousands of dollars for speeches to Goldman SachsSanders faces challenges on electability and how to broaden his appeal to voters past New HampshireWhat kind of car does the senator drive?

As the leader of this nation, will you advance a racial justice agenda that will dismantle -- not reform, not make progress -- but will begin to dismantle structural racism in the United States?\" \"Yes,\" O'Malley replied, but before he could say more, the demonstrators in front of the stage shouted over him by reciting names of black women who have died in police custody. While they shouted, O'Malley stood in silence. At one point he turned to Oso on stage: \"My people came here as immigrants from Ireland.\"Below, dozens shouted several chants in unison.\"Black lives matter!

O'Malley said he wanted to require police departments to report all police-involved shootings and brutality complaints and he called on departments to implement civilian review boards. He vowed to release a wide-ranging plan on criminal justice reform.The demonstrators started shouting and booing again when O'Malley said: \"Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.\"O'Malley later apologized for the remarks, telling This Week in Blackness, a digital news site, that he \"meant no disrespect\" to the black community.\"That was a mistake on my part and I meant no disrespect,\" O'Malley told the outlet. \"I did not understand the tremendous passion, commitment and feeling and depth of feeling that all of us should be attaching to this issue.\"And when he stepped off stage, he chanted, \"Black lives matter!

The candidate, a favorite of Netroots Nation, threatened to leave if they continued to interrupt him.\"Black lives, of course, matter. I spent 50 years of my life fighting for civil rights and for dignity,\" he said. \"But if you don't want me to be here, that's OK. I don't want to outscream people.\" Sanders proceeded to deliver his usual presidential stump speech over sporadic shouting from below. After talking over one another, Sanders eventually ditched pre-planned remarks and tried to address questions from demonstrators. \"Black people are dying in this country because we have a criminal justice system which is out of control, a system in which over 50% of young African-American kids are unemployed,\" Sanders said. \"It is estimated that a black baby born today has a one in four chance of ending up in the criminal justice system.\" 16 photos: 'Black lives matter' protests 16 photos: 'Black lives matter' protests Demonstrators chant during a rally in downtown Manhattan on December 13.Hide Caption 1 of 1616 photos: 'Black lives matter' protests Police arrest a \"Black Lives Matter\" protester on Saturday, December 20, in Bloomington, Minnesota.

Hide Caption 16 of 16Since leaving Washington in 2009 after eight years in the White House, Bush has not shown interest in being in the public spotlight or playing a leadership role within the Republican Party. His visit to North Charleston comes as other members of the Bush clan have also started to play a more active role in Jeb Bush's presidential campaign. In New Hampshire, Bush's mother and former first lady, Barbara Bush, campaigned with her younger son. Jeb Bush: New Hampshire race is 'wide open'On Monday, George W. Bush also discussed life after the White House, which he lightheartedly referred to as \"the after life.\"\"Laura and I loved our years in Washington, but we really don't miss it too much,\" he said, bringing the audience to laughter. He joked that the couple now spends a lot of time on their ranch in Texas, and that that as tree farmers, he still gets opportunities to practice his \"stump speech.\"He also quipped about his new hobby of painting: \"Let me assure you, I know that the signature's worth more than the painting.\"There were plenty of attendees at the North Charleston Coliseum who said their main motivation for coming to Jeb Bush's rally Monday night was to see an ex-president in person. Sharon Hickey, a New Hampshire resident who rents a home in South Carolina for a part of the year, said it was \"wonderful\" to see George W. Bush campaign for his brother. \"We're honored to be here to see, to be in the presence of, a former President,\" Hickey said. Joe Kelley, a retired fighter fighter from Boston who owns a second home in Murrells Inlet, is currently undecided but leaning towards Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. As he waited to George W. Bush to take the stage, he said he thought the ex-President did a \"fine enough job\" in the White House.\"In my life time I've seen one President in person, Bill Clinton,\" Kelley said. \"Just to see a president in person -- I think it would be nice.\"", "article_highlights": "George W.

Since Monday night's Iowa caucuses, which Clinton very narrowly won, the two have volleyed sharp words over the ideological direction of the Democratic Party in the post-Barack Obama era.

Clinton started to explain that Goldman wasn't the only group that paid her for speeches. But when Cooper interjected and asked, \"Did you have to be paid $675,000?\" Clinton appeared caught off guard. \"Well, I don't know. Um, that's what they offered,\" she said. Clinton went on to insist that at the time of the speeches, she was undecidedon whether to seek the White House.\"I didn't know, to be honest, I wasn't -- I wasn't committed to running,\" Clinton said, uncharacteristically tripping over her words. \"I didn't -- I didn't know whether I was running or not. I didn't.\"And in one of the more revealing exchanges of the night, Cooper asked Clinton what would be wrong with the so-called \"political revolution\" that Sanders frequent calls for.

They brought in some new multi-millionaires to pump the money in.\"The 60 minutes Clinton stood on stage also confirmed, once again, that her vote for the Iraq War continues to haunt her 13 years later.

The senator, who has drawn massive crowds to his campaign rallies and has somewhat of a cult following among younger voters, said history shows that Democrats win elections when there is large voter turnout.There is simply more enthusiasm fueling his campaign than Clinton's, he said.'Excitement and energy'\"An objective assessment,\" Sanders argued, \"would say there is more excitement and energy in our campaign.\"JUST WATCHEDSanders: I want Trump to win the Republican nominationReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSanders: I want Trump to win the Republican nomination 01:54He also took a shot at Trump, calling him a candidate who doesn't support working Americans.

Sanders has no viable countrywide political organization, so he must foment a grassroots uprising. His task is complicated by the fact that although he caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate, he has always been a political independent wary of formal party affiliations.Taking on the Clinton machineHe must take on the Clinton political machine that has retooled after its defeat in 2008. He's a minnow in the money game in a campaign that will be awash in billions of dollars.He's not exactly a polished pol either, with an unrepentant message of class warfare that makes him an unlikely candidate to win over Middle America.And many Democrats are only beginning to learn who Sanders actually is. He's a long shot, but has shown some momentum since indicating he would take the plunge into the presidential race late last month. In a new Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday, Sanders was at 15% of Democratic voters nationwide, up from the 5% he managed in a CNN national poll last month.His campaign launch, on a Lake Champlain boardwalk that he saved from developers as Burlington's mayor, had the air of a hippie revival or a folk festival.One woman twirled a hula hoop and shouted \"Hooping for Bernie\"; people lined up for free helpings of locally made Ben and Jerry's ice cream; and kids carried banners naming Sanders their political superhero. Vermont-based warm-up act Mango Jam pumped out a fusion of Zydeco, Cajun and Caribbean rhythms.JUST WATCHEDBernie Sanders' brother is also running for officeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBernie Sanders' brother is also running for office 02:20The place pulsed with the hopeful political energy that is unique to the start of U.S. presidential campaigns when anything seems possible -- even in minute, ultraliberal blue states with three electoral votes.Of course, in the highly unlikely scenario that Sanders is elected president, enacting his revolutionary agenda faces even greater odds. Another long-shot, transformational president has already demonstrated how hard turning campaign slogans into reality can be.If there's one lesson of Barack Obama's White House, it's that passing social reforms such as Obamacare -- which falls way short of the kind of single-payer health system Sanders prefers -- can be almost impossible and exact a heavy political price.Sanders surely knows this.He might be a dreamer, but he knows the realities of politics: A pragmatic streak leavened his idealism during four terms as mayor; he railed against the Iraq war but became a champion of veterans in the Senate.So it may be fair to question whether, unlike his devoted Vermont cadres, a politician as experienced as Sanders thinks he can actually win the presidency, especially as political reality is weighted against him.America's middle class, while hurting, is hardly a simmering proletariat ready for the economic shock therapy he prescribes.Opponents attack Vermont's recordAnd political opponents argue that for all his flamboyance, Vermont has not done that well in the Sanders era.\"Fear and frustration are a powerful political cocktail,\" said a statement from the Vermont Republican Party on Tuesday.\"All you have to do is take a good look at Vermont's demographic and economic realities -- and our growing crisis of affordability -- to get a good look at what the hangover from a Sanders administration would look and feel like.\"But to simply write off the Sanders campaign as some kind of personal vanity project, or a token quest to insert progressive values into the 2016 campaign, does him an injustice.His messages, the timing of his campaign, the polls and his personal qualities suggest that the Sanders campaign could end up more than a flight of political fancy and become a real headache for the Clinton machine.For starters, the 2016 Democratic primary campaign seems to be shaping itself around the issues of economic justice and fairness for which he first fought amid the political turmoil of 1960s Chicago where he was a student.READ: Bernie Sanders takes aim at Wall Street in presidential launchIn a recent interview with CNN, the candidate's UK-based brother Larry disputed the notion that Sanders is a man of the fringe.\"I don't think we are out of the mainstream. I think that what we have noticed is that the mainstream has been ignored for a long time,\" he said.While the solutions that Bernie Sanders advocates to fix America's problems are radical, his diagnosis of the national mood is not.Health care, child care, college and medical costs preoccupy middle class families, whomever they vote for, a fact reflected in the way Clinton and Republicans Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Rick Santorum have emphasized income inequality in their campaigns.One advantage Sanders may have over this crowd is the crucial elixir of presidential runs -- \"authenticity\" -- said Vermont University political science professor Garrison Nelson, who has known Sanders for decades.\"Bernie Sanders has been saying these same things for over 40 years. Bernie is not tailoring his speeches to the agenda. The agenda has caught up with Bernie Sanders.\"Another way Sanders debunks the hopeless crusade metaphor is that he's not just some political gadfly. He narrowly won his first race for mayor, then got elected over and over again, and has been in Congress for a quarter century.Iowa could be a tough sell for SandersBut it's not a given that his brusque style and pyrotechnical calls for a revolution will go down well in Iowa, for instance, where voters like to be wooed rather than harangued.\"It is going to be a hard sell,\" said Nelson, who said his friend must find a sweet spot on the issue of income inequality. \"Bernie is counting on that -- that degree of resentment and that degree of anger.\"While Sanders is a novelty in Iowa, he's a known commodity in New Hampshire -- where the overlap from the Burlington media market makes him well-known and could give him a leg up in the primary campaign.But Sanders must also show that he has got the financial muscle to even get that far -- though he says he is certain he can raise $50 million, after quickly pulling in contributions of around $4 million within days of first saying he would run for president.\"That should give him enough money to be competitive in the four early states,\" said Eric Davis, a veteran Vermont political analyst and professor emeritus at Middlebury College, referring to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada.READ: Windfall at Bernie's: Sanders raises $1.5 million in 24 hourBut Davis asked: \"What state is his campaign going to be in at the end of those four early contests?\" And if by some miracle he won the nomination, he would then find it difficult to counter questions about whether his left-wing politics would be palatable to a wider electorate.Still, polls suggest that Sanders is a viable candidate to be the leading alternative to Clinton among Democrats -- though he lags behind the former first lady by 50%.A Quinnipiac University poll in Iowa found that 15% of likely caucus goers would back him while 18% of likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire prefer him -- numbers that give him a genuine platform in the race.He's ahead of other possible Democratic long shots, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia.And while he may not beat Clinton, Sanders can at least shape the economic debate in the Democratic primary and force her to confront her liabilities on trade and the influence of big money in politics.Appealing to liberal DemocratsClinton will also be wary of alienating liberal Democrats who support Sanders and are suspicious of her candidacy, but whom she needs to swell her margins in Midwestern swing states if she is to win the general election.Sanders' hopes of causing a stir in 2016 also depend on his capacity to show the side of his character that has won him such a loyal following in Vermont, where he has convinced voters he is on their side.Ann Taylor of Burlington, a self described \"old hippie,\" said Sanders was pushing a message that America needed to hear: \"This is probably the only candidate that is going to fight for working people. And I know he is influencing Sen. Clinton. Bernie will do so much for working people, it is unbelievable.\"23 photos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlightU.S. Sen.

Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, announced his run in an email to supporters on April 30.

He said Rubio had a \"very, very bad night\" and called on him to drop out of the race. And he took at shot at Cruz, after spending months saying the Texas senator is ineligible to run for President because he was born in Canada. \"He should do well in Maine because it is very close to Canada,\" Trump said.Tough night for RubioIt was another grim night for Rubio, who has so far won only one of the 19 contests in the GOP race, despite billing himself as the only candidate with the potential to unify the Republican Party and the broad appeal needed to beat Clinton.While Kansas and Maine may represent too small a sample to validate Cruz's claims that the race is now a two-man affair, it is clear that his win will be parsed for signs that it represents the stirrings of a backlash against Trump, after the billionaire became embroiled in a controversy he was slow to repudiate the Ku Klux Klan, and introduced a vulgar note into a Republican debate on Thursday night.On the other hand, the victory by Cruz in Kansas appears to fit squarely into historical precedent. Like Cruz, the previous two victors of that state's GOP contests, Rick Santorum in 2012 and Mike Huckabee in 2008, had strong appeal among evangelicals which they had also demonstrated by winning the Iowa caucuses.Neither went on to win the nomination.And despite his win Saturday in Maine and on Tuesday in Alaska, there are still doubts about whether Cruz can expand his appeal beyond hard-core conservatives in a national race. Super Saturday voting took place in the wake of former Republican nominee Mitt Romney's assault on Trump, which ignited a civil war within the GOP between establishment figures and the billionaire's army of angry 'outsider' voters.Democratic raceSanders' wins in the Kansas and Nebraska \u2014both caucus states \u2014 could offer him a boost after he was overshadowed by Clinton on Super Tuesday. But they also appear to underline that Sanders is stronger among largely white, less diverse electorates. That is a problem for Sanders because the nomination could be decided by the large numbers of minority voters in the Democratic coalition, to which Clinton has demonstrated she has more appeal.Clinton's campaign also worked in both states to narrow the margin of her defeat, learning the lessons from the 2008 campaign when Barack Obama piled up large delegate counts in caucus states.The manageable size of her defeats in the two states and her big win in Louisiana will mean that she will likely end the night slightly further ahead of Sanders in the overall delegate count than when she started it.The Super Saturday contests offer a chance for the two front-runners to quicken their momentum after they both came out of the contests last Tuesday with solid delegate leads. They still face major battles in crucial elections in Michigan, Ohio and Florida over the coming weeks.Clinton has a lead of about 200 pledged delegates over Sanders, while Trump leads Cruz by around 100 delegates and is about 200 delegates ahead of the third place candidate Rubio.Rubio put on a brave face, saying that the states being contested on Super Saturday favored other candidates, but predicted that his fortunes would soon change. He predicted victory in his home state of Florida on March 15.\"The map only gets friendlier for us after tonight,\" Rubio told reporters during a trip to Puerto Rico, which holds a Republican primary on Sunday. \"There will be more delegates awarded in Florida than basically every state that voted tonight combined.\"", "article_highlights": "Trump wins Kentucky GOP caucuses, CNN projectsRepublicans are battling for 155 delegates on Super SaturdayDemocrats have 109 pledged delegates at stake", "article_author": "Stephen Collinson, CNN"}

About 9-in-10 said they were dissatisfied with the federal government, including about 4-in-10 who were angry about the way it was working. And for many, the dissatisfaction extends to the GOP itself. Half said they felt betrayed by politicians from the Republican Party, and about the same share said they wanted the next president to be from outside the political establishment.The gender gapThe results revealed a generational divide among women who voted Democrat.Women under 45 overwhelmingly picked Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton, according to exit polls, with women under 30 backing the Vermont senator by an almost 4-1 margin.

Additionally, 40% say they'd like the next president to pursue more liberal policies than Obama, and Sanders carries more than 80% of their votes.But it's not an anti-Clinton electorate: 6-in-10 would be satisfied if Clinton won the nomination and about 55% say her positions on the issues are about right, with 6-in-10 saying she shares their values. And about half of voters say they trust both candidates on a range of major issues, including health care, handling an international crisis and gun policy, but Sanders has an edge on handling the economy and income inequality.But Clinton's big challenge remains that a majority doubt that she is honest and trustworthy.Democrats happier than Republicans, but concerns remainThough Democrats voting on Tuesday were less apt to say they felt betrayed by their party or to express anger with the federal government, about three-quarters said they were worried about the economy. About 4-in-10 said they thought life for the next generation of Americans would be worse than life today, and 9-in-10 said they thought the nation's economy favored the wealthy.Still, Democrats who went to the polls Tuesday -- to vote in a race featuring two seasoned politicians -- were more apt than Republicans to say they wanted the next president to have experience in politics, only about one-quarter said they preferred a president from outside the political establishment.Only about one-quarter of Democrats said they made up their minds in the final days of the contest, well below the share of Republicans deciding late.Just one-quarter of voters in the GOP primary Tuesday say they are born-again or evangelical Christians, well below the majority of Iowa caucusgoers who said they were born-again or evangelical. Likewise, New Hampshire GOP voters were less likely to be deeply conservative than were the Iowa caucusgoers: About one-quarter describe themselves as \"very conservative\" among Tuesday's voters.Voters in both the Democratic and Republican contests were more apt to say the candidates' positions on the issues were central to their vote than to say their choice rested on personal or leadership qualities.Economic issues topped the list of issues in both contests. For the Democrats, the economy and jobs ran evenly with income inequality, with about one-third citing each as a top issue, while for Republicans, 3-in-10 cited the economy, and about one-quarter each government spending or terrorism.New Hampshire voters who are registered to vote without a party affiliation can choose whether to participate in the Democratic election or the Republican one. These undeclared voters made up about one-third of those casting ballots in the Republican race, and about 4-in-10 on the Democratic side.On both sides, however, smaller shares report participating in a primary for the first time than did so in Iowa's caucuses.The New Hampshire exit polls were conducted at 44 precincts around the state among 1,257 Republican voters and 1,434 Democratic voters.

The second vision, of course, is Sanders' plan to break up big banks, close tax loopholes and make the wealthy \"pay their fair share.\"\"Will they like me? No,\" Sanders says in the ad, another jab at Clinton, who said at a debate in December that \"everyone should\" like her. \"Will they begin to play by the rule if I am president, you better believe it.\" Sanders is still leading in New Hampshire and a new poll released Thursday shows Clinton up by only 2% in Iowa. His campaign has also done better than even it expected, and raised $73 million in 2015, well exceeding the goals it when the campaign launched.RELATED: Poll: Clinton lead narrows in IowaMeantime, the tone of the Democratic race has grown more combative, with Clinton's campaign turning up the heat as well, running an ad that indirectly call out Sanders on gun control. Ahead of Tuesday's State of the Union address, Clinton called indirectly challenged Sanders to \"pick a side\" on guns -- either with the gun lobby or with President Barack Obama. \"I am with him,\" Clinton says in the ad of Obama. RELATED: Clinton: Sanders 'reliable vote for the gun lobby'And Clinton used the bulk of her stump speech Tuesday in Iowa to contrast herself with Sanders, knocking him on guns, taxes and health care. \"Don't talk to me about standing up to corporate interests and big powers,\" Clinton said of Sanders in Ames. \"I've got the scars to show for it and I am proud of every single one of them.\" But neither Clinton nor her campaign aides, however, ever expressly promised not to go negative in the Democratic race. In an interview with CBS in September, Clinton said she \"had no interest\" in attacking Sanders. Sanders and Clinton have long emphasized their differences with one another, but going to air with contrast ads was something Sanders' aides thought would be out of the question at the start of their campaign. \"If we do that, we're done,\" Tad Devine, Sanders' senior strategist, told Mother Jones in June. \"If we do a classic comparative ad, it's over. We'll have to be smarter.\" In New Hampshire, Sanders again said he doesn't want to go negative. \"I believe the American people deserve campaigns which are based on the issues that are impacting their lives,\" he said. \"They don't wanna see candidates go around saying, I'm great and everyone else is terrible and awful. That's not the type of campaign I've run or will run.\"And Sanders' campaign rejects that idea that its latest ad, which will run in Iowa and New Hampshire, is directed at Clinton or breaks the candidate's pledge.\"It makes contrasts that both drew on the Des Moines debate and he made in the New York City speech but this is not an ad directed at Secretary Clinton exclusively,\" Michael Briggs, Sanders' spokesman, said Thursday. \"It's about people in the Democratic establishment who believe you can take Wall Street's money and then somehow turn around and rein in the greed, recklessness and illegal behavior. Obviously she is part of the establishment that Wall Street has showered with financial support. Bernie is not.\"Clinton campaign aides said scoffed at the notion that the ad is not directed squarely at Clinton, with some feeling the Wall Street line is more of a personal critique of Clinton -- questioning her commitment to her platform -- than an attack on a policy position.RELATED: Bill Clinton: I'm not surprised this race is tighteningTone shift started with Jefferson-Jackson dinnerThis tension between the different kind of campaign Sanders hoped to run and the realities of a presidential race have been building ever since Sanders used his speech at the Iowa Jefferson-Jackson dinner to lambast Clinton's past positions, implying that the former secretary of state took poll-tested positions based on political expediency.\"I pledge to you that every day I will fight for the public interest, not the corporate interest. I will not abandon any segment of American society -- whether you're gay or black or Latino or poor, or working class -- just because it is politically expedient at a given time,\" he said.Ever since that speech -- which saw some Sanders' aides get in on the Clinton bashing on social media -- the tone of the Sanders campaign has been decidedly more negative than the operation he and his aides sketched early in 2015.Days later in an interview with Charlie Rose, Sanders listed his differences with Hillary Clinton and asked voters to consider who will champion those positions. \"And if people think Hillary Clinton is that candidate, go for it,\" he said sarcastically.RELATED: Bernie Sanders refutes Clinton attacks on guns, health careSanders then started to turn his differences with Clinton, particularly on the consistency of the positions they have held, as a blunt object to hit her with. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Sanders said consistency on issues \"does speak to the character of a person,\" a comment that irked many in the Clinton campaign as Sanders questioning their candidate's character.Sanders aides have indicated that the candidate does not want to go negative in the race, pointing to his past races as proof positive that he does not enjoy that kind of campaigning.\"Look, I have worked for him off and on for 30 years, I managed his Senate mapping in 2006, a very vicious race where we were attacked on television and elsewhere,\" Jeff Weaver, Sanders' campaign manager, said. \"We never went negative and I think voters appreciated that.\"But does that mean Sanders' campaign won't go after Clinton on issues they think she is weak on? No, said Weaver.\"We do think it is fair for him to offer contrast on positions and issues between the two candidates,\" Weaver added. \"I mean, this ultimately is a selection, an election is a selection, right? And I think it is fair to highlight to voters what you think are the differences on policy between your candidacy and your opponents candidacy.\"", "article_highlights": "Bernie Sanders had promised not to go negative in the race against Hillary ClintonBut the race is getting nastier, and Sanders has a new ad highlighting differences between him and Clinton on Wall Street", "article_author": "Dan Merica and Jeff Zeleny, CNN"}

File away that Trump-Cruz detente. All those debate-stage friendships are over. Sticking to South Carolina's tradition of bare-knuckled politics, Saturday night's debate featured the most bitter exchanges of the campaign so far. The audience was equally vocal, and the atmosphere indicated that the negative -- and personal -- attacks will only increase as the race drags on.In one of the most memorable exchanges of the night, Donald Trump unloaded on his former friend Ted Cruz. \"You are the single biggest liar,\" he said of his former friend Cruz. Cruz had just accused Trump of supporting government funding for Planned Parenthood, and Trump had shot back that Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' decisions (like upholding Obamacare) are Cruz's to bear. At one point Trump attacked the Texas senator by saying: \"This guy will say anything. Nasty guy. Now I know why he doesn't have one endorsement from any of his colleagues. He's a nasty guy.\"As evidence, Trump pointed to the Cruz campaign's tactics in Iowa, where aides asserted -- inaccurately -- that former neurosurgeon Ben Carson was dropping out of the race while voters were still making decisions at the state's caucuses.Cruz shot back: \"It's fairly remarkable to see Donald defending Ben after he called him pathological and compared him to a child molester. ... Donald has a weird pattern. When you point to his own record, he screams, 'liar, liar, liar.'\" 2. Rubio vs. Cruz, en espa\u00f1olSpeaking of attacks: The race's two freshman senators of Cuban heritage, Florida's Marco Rubio and Texas's Ted Cruz, really don't like each other.

But there was a new element Saturday night: Cruz shouted at Rubio -- in Spanish.Cruz had accused Rubio of saying on Univision in Spanish that he would not repeal President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration.Rubio retorted: \"I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish.\"That's when Cruz looked at Rubio and uttered a few words in Spanish, challenging Rubio to continue in that language \"if you want.\" READ: The GOP's bitter South Carolina brawlThe battle was over the same immigration issues that have been the subject of attacks between the two for months: Rubio sponsored an immigration overhaul measure in 2013 that would have created a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Cruz opposed it, but offered his own amendment swapping out a path to citizenship for legal status. Rubio has repeatedly raised it to muddy their differences on immigration. \"Ted Cruz has just been telling lies,\" Rubio said.Though each one scored hits as they battled each other during the debate, Rubio turned in a noticeably better performance than he did last time -- when he faltered in the days leading up to the New Hampshire primary, which he partly blamed for his fifth-place finish.Throughout that exchange and the entire night, Rubio was aided by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie's decision to drop out of the race. It was Christie's battering that led the Florida senator to stumble in the last debate.On Saturday, Bush stepped in to play that role, saying: \"I feel like I have to get into my inner Chris Christie.\" But unlike Christie, the debate moved on and he dropped the matter.3. Battling over BushSouth Carolina was where Bush and Rubio -- the teacher and the student in their Florida statehouse days -- were supposed to go head-to-head. Instead, the two of them teamed up against another opponent, Donald Trump. What got them going: Trump blamed George W. Bush for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The two mounted a fierce defense of the 43rd president's handling of national security, while Trump trashed him. That's a risky move, given that angering South Carolina's military-oriented electorate could endanger his big lead in the polls.\"Obviously the war in Iraq was a big, fat mistake,\" Trump declared in an encounter on foreign policy. JUST WATCHEDTrump asked if George W. Bush should've been impeachedReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump asked if George W. Bush should've been impeached 02:16\"I am sick and tired of him going after my family,\" Bush shot back. \"While Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus to keep us safe.\" That's when Trump hit even harder. \"I lost hundreds of friends. The World Trade Center came down during the reign of George W. Bush,\" Trump said. \"He kept us safe? That is not safe.\"Rubio jumped in and defended Bush 43, blaming another president -- Bill Clinton -- for failing to take Osama bin Laden out \"when he had a chance.\"Trump's line of attack drew boos from the audience. But Trump didn't seem to mind. He dismissed a chorus of boos as coming from Jeb Bush's donors. 4. Kasich's Achilles heelKasich's single biggest weakness with Republican primary voters has long been his decision to expand Medicaid in Ohio under Obama's health care law. His second-place finish in New Hampshire finally had Kasich -- who prefers to stay out of the fray -- playing defense on that decision. The attack came from Bush, who said: \"We should be fighting Obamacare, repealing Obamacare, replacing it with something totally different.\" JUST WATCHEDGov. Kasich defends Medicaid expansionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGov. Kasich defends Medicaid expansion 01:15Kasich made his case in moral terms, aligning himself with former President Ronald Reagan, the conservative hero who, the Ohio governor said, \"expanded Medicaid five times,\" arguing that the government-run insurance program helps poor people transition to productive work. He also showed he's been studying the Bush opposition research book, saying that in the former Florida governor's first four years, \"his Medicaid program grew twice as fast as mine, okay? It's just a fact.\" \"He knows that I'm not pro-Obamacare, never have been,\" Kasich said. Kasich doesn't often mix it up with his debate-stage rivals. All the fighting, he said, has the GOP \"fixin' to lose the election.\" But he could find himself increasingly under scrutiny if he's able to prove in South Carolina that his appeal to moderates and establishment-type Republicans extends beyond New Hampshire.5. Replacing ScaliaHours after the news broke that Scalia had died, the fight over when to replace the conservative judicial figure quickly took shape as a defining issue of the 2016 presidential race.The Republican presidential field thinks one of its members -- not Obama -- should pick Scalia's successor.Trump said Senate Republicans should \"delay, delay, delay.\" Cruz agreed, saying that \"the Senate needs to stand strong and say we're not going to give up the Supreme Court for a generation.\" Bush didn't call on Obama to skip nominating a replacement, but said it should be a \"consensus\" pick -- unlikely in today's partisan environment. READ: Justice Antonin Scalia's death quickly sparks political battleIt was the one issue over which Republicans expressed broad consensus, focusing their attacks on Democrats. (In fact, the audience put its finger on the scale -- not to support a candidate, but to boo CBS moderator John Dickerson after he'd fact-checked Cruz's inaccurate assertion that no Supreme Court nominee has been confirmed in an election year in the past 80 years. Anthony Kennedy was confirmed on February 3, 1988, during Ronald Reagan's final year in office.)The comments from the GOP field came just after Obama had said he does, indeed, intend to nominate a replacement for Scalia -- and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had said he wouldn't give that nominee a vote. In Denver, Hillary Clinton had blasted McConnell's stance as \"totally out of step with history and constitutional principles.\"", "article_highlights": "The candidates leveled personal attacks on issues ranging from immigration to foreign policyThe debate came hours after the death of revered conservative icon Justice Antonin Scalia", "article_author": "Eric Bradner, CNN"}

While Clinton's use of a private email address and server to conduct State Department business has not been a central focus of the panel, Gowdy has said the arrangement raises serious questions about whether the former secretary has handed over all of her Benghazi-related emails.Committee investigators are expected to take a broader look into Sullivan's role developing the administration's handling of Libya, but will also likely drill down on an August 2011 memo where he outlined how Clinton should play up her handling of Libya.A Democratic source on the committee expressed concerns that Republicans have veered away from investigating the attack itself into turning into a hit on Clinton, as she pursues the White House. \"Our concern is that Republicans' obsession with derailing her presidential bid has shelved much of the (committee's) core work about the Benghazi attack,\" the Democratic source said. \"For example, the committee has abandoned its plan to have 11 hearings this year, and it hasn't held a single hearing since January -- eight months ago.

This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists,\" he said.Specifically, Sanders promised to spend $1 trillion to create 13 million jobs in a massive infrastructure program, to double the minimum wage to $15 an hour, to end the \"greed\" of the \"billionaire class\" by raising taxes for the wealthy and to break up the largest financial institutions in the country.In a progressive, government-led program that would indeed represent a revolution if it was ever passed, Sanders promised a single-payer state health care system, free college tuition at colleges and universities and to reverse climate change.The Brooklyn-born Sanders denies he is a political outlier at the fringes of mainstream politics. Instead, he accuses his fellow politicians and the media of ignoring the reality that the wealthy are doing better than ever in the wake of the worst recession in 80 years while many in the middle class are still struggling.Since he confirmed on April 30 that he would launch a presidential run, Sanders, 73, has enjoyed a boost in the polls in the key early states.A Quinnipiac University polls in Iowa found that 15% of likely caucus goers would back him while 18% of likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire backed his campaign. Clinton however dominated the surveys, with 60% and 62% ratings in the two polls, respectively.However, while he lags behind Clinton, Sanders, for now, is ahead of other possible Democratic long-shot candidates, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is set to make an announcement on his intentions at the weekend and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb.The polls reflect the fact that many Democrats privately believe that Clinton is the best chance they have to hang on to the White House, and the former secretary of state is an even more prohibitive frontrunner than before she lost to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary race.But Sanders, a rumpled and sometimes grumpy figure, who prides his independence and who has spent decades questioning the power of corporate barons on Wall Street may at least have the issues on his side.The theme of income inequality is dominating the economic argument in the nascent 2016 campaign -- not just among Democrats, but it is also beginning to feature in the rhetoric of top Republican hopefuls, including Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio.23 photos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlightU.S. Sen.

Sanders won the state's primary the next day, an upset that delivered a sharp blow to Clinton's hopes of quickly securing the nomination.Hide Caption 23 of 23Sanders hopes of mounting a credible campaign may rest on whether he can corral support from liberal Democrats who are pining for a run from another populist economic crusader Warren, who insists she is taking a pass on the race despite wildfire support among the party's grass roots.In many ways, Sanders is an anti-politician. Despite serving as mayor of Burlington for four terms and winning seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate, he glorifies in being an outsider, and with his wild white hair and brusque manner lacks the polish of most Washington politicians -- and presidential candidates.Sanders will be especially closely watched for the way he handles Clinton and could pose perhaps the most risk for the former first lady on the debate stage, where he can be a tenacious advocate for his policy positions.But he insisted that the election was not about personality clashes.\"This campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It is not about Hillary Clinton. It is not about Jeb Bush or anyone else. This campaign is about the needs of the American people,\" he said.But Clinton will be mindful of the fact that the first signs of vulnerability in her 2008 Democratic primary campaign came when she tripped up in an exchange with another long-shot contender, then Sen. Christopher Dodd.One area where Sanders could make things dicey for Clinton is over the vast Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade pact which is at the centerpiece of Obama's foreign policy. Sanders and many liberal Democrats oppose the deal because they believe it will accelerate the loss of U.S. jobs to low wage economies overseas. Clinton has yet to say whether she is for or against the proposed deal.Sanders also had sharp words for the media, arguing that it often obsessed on trivialities and character issues, rather than the policies Americans cared about.\"Politics in a democratic society should not be treated like a baseball game, a game show or a soap opera. The times are too serious for that,\" he said.6 photos: Who's running for president?Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, John Kasich, Ted Cruz,Donald Trump and Marco Rubio Hide Caption 1 of 66 photos: Who's running for president?Businessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination.

After Trump whacked his poor attendance record in the Senate, he tried to make the case that he's skipped votes in order to campaign for president and fix a broken Washington.

Florida became the first state in the nation with a statewide voucher program.It allowed students in some of the worst schools to get vouchers of up to $3,389 to attend private and parochial schools. But the Florida Supreme Court struck it down in 2006. In 2001, Bush signed into law a tax-credit scholarship program, which has grown into the largest single school-choice program of any state.VERDICT: TrueFact check: Ben Carson says there have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.When asked to comment about Donald Trump linking childhood vaccines to autism, Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon by training, said \"there have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.\" He said the claim was spread over the past two decades thanks to a now-discredited study, published in 1998, that linked the measles, mumps and reubella vaccine to autism. Dr. Andrew Wakefield was the lead researcher of the study, published in the British medical journal The Lancet. After learning that Wakefield was compensated for his research by a law firm hoping to sue the makers of the vaccine, most of the co-authors of the paper withdrew their names.Drs. @RealBenCarson and @RandPaul discuss vaccines with @realDonaldTrump http://t.co/jcEf6bW9ja #CNNDebate #GOPdebate http://t.co/usGOrqNJ1v\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 17, 2015In 2010, Wakefield lost his medical license, and in 2011, the journal retracted the study. Subsequent studies looking for a link between the vaccine and autism haven't found any.In February, in the midst of a measles outbreak, the autism advocacy organization Autism Speaks issued a statement stating, \"over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.\"VERDICT: TrueRELATED: #CNNDebate: Post-game buzzFact check: Christie says he supported medical marijuana.\"In New Jersey we have medical marijuana laws, which I have supported and implemented,\" Christie said. \"This is not medical marijuana, this goes a much further step beyond. This is recreational use of marijuana. This is much different. And so while he (Rand Paul) would like to use the sympathetic story to back up his point it doesn't work. I am not against medical marijuana. We do it in New Jersey. But I am against the recreational use of marijuana.\" Christie did support a modest expansion of the state's medical marijuana program in 2013, but that was after he fought the implementation of the program signed by his Democratic predecessor, Jon Corzine. And, one year after he signed the medical marijuana expansion, he criticized medical marijuana as a \"front for legalization.\"RELATED: Christie seeks changes in New Jersey medical marijuana billChristie did allow an expansion of the medical marijuana program created by his predecessor, but he never mentioned the times he fought medical marijuana in his debate answer.VERDICT: True, but misleadingFact check: Donald Trump says Wisconsin is losing $2.2 billion.In November 2014, the Wisconsin Department of Administration said state agencies' budget requests would exceed expected revenues by $2.2 billion dollars for the 2015-2017 budget cycle.However, Wisconsin is required by state law to balance its budget. Therefore, state lawmakers cut spending, including slashing funding for the University of Wisconsin by $250 million. The budget that Gov. Scott Walker signed in July did not have a deficit.VERDICT: FalseFact check: Sen. Ted Cruz's criticism of the Iran nuclear agreement.\"There are several facilities in Iran they designate as military facilities that are off-limit altogether,\" the Texas senator said. \"Beyond that, the other facilities, we give them 24 days' notice before inspecting them. That is designed to allow them to hide the evidence and most astonishingly, this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves.\"The Additional Protocol, which Iran signed onto under the nuclear agreement, allows the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, to seek access to any site, including military sites.Specific access is determined by a parallel agreement between Iran and the IAEA, often referred to by the deal's detractors as \"secret side deals.\"The 24-day window Cruz referred to comes into play if Iran and the IAEA are not able to agree on access to a particular site.From the time IAEA requests access to that site, they and Iran have 14 days to either arrange access or find another way to address the IAEA's concerns to that group's satisfaction. If its concerns aren't met, the P5+1 members (which consists of the U.S., Russia, China, France, the UK and Germany) have a week to determine a way to address it, and Iran has three days to comply with their order.The notion of self-inspections first arose when details of a draft of the so-called \"side deal\" between Iran and the IAEA were reported in the media.They revealed that Iran would participate in monitoring and inspecting the Parchin military facility, which the West suspects that Iran has used for military nuclear work.U.S. officials say that while Iranians would have a role in inspecting the site, inspectors from other countries will participate as well and the IAEA would be monitoring the process throughout. The leader of the IAEA said the suggestion of self-inspections \"misrepresent the way in which we will undertake this important verification work.\"But neither the United States nor the IAEA have made the agreement public, citing precedent in keeping IAEA pacts confidential.Cruz's assertion falsely suggests that all nuclear inspections in Iran would be conducted by the Iranians, but without access to the full document, it's unclear exactly how inspections at Parchin will proceed. And the assertion that military facilities are entirely off-limits is also false.VERDICT: False in regard to self-inspections, but It's Complicated on the 24-day noticeFact check: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio claims \"The (legal immigration system) primarily is built whether you have a relative living here instead of merit.\" Approximately two-thirds of the people who were admitted to the United States from 2000 to 2013 as lawful permanent residents were admitted on the basis of family ties, according to a November 2014 report from the U.S. Congressional Research Service. In 2013, the most recent year for which we have aggregate data, of the 990,553 foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States as lawful permanent residents, 649,763 were admitted on the basis of family ties. .@marcorubio: \"We have a legal immigration system that no longer works\" http://t.co/jcEf6bW9ja #CNNDebate #GOPDebate http://t.co/9GrahISPZ8\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 17, 2015If employment offers or specific professional achievement qualifies as \"merit,\" then 161,110 immigrants became lawful permanent residents under this category in 2013, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The percentage of this category, called \"employment-based preferences\" constituted 16.3% of the total number of immigrants who became lawful permanent residents in 2013. Verdict: TrueFact check: Rubio says America is the \"most generous\" nation on immigration.Rubio said that America is the most generous country on immigration.\"Despite the fact that we have the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally,\" Rubio said.The Department of Homeland Security's data shows that just over 1 million immigrants moved here legally in 2012. That number dropped a bit to 990,553 in 2013, but these numbers still make the United States the highest in sheer number of immigrants accepted. Germany is the next largest acceptor of immigrants, with almost 966,000 in 2012. When you look at the number of immigrants compared to the population, however, the U.S. does not look as generous. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United States ranks 19th with these immigrants, making up about 0.33% of the total population.VERDICT: True, but misleadingFact check: Bush says U.S. has failed to bolster ties to any nation under Obama.President Barack Obama has reopened ties with at least two countries that the U.S. had no diplomatic relations with when he entered office.\"What I know to be true is that the next president of the United States is going to have to fix an extraordinary difficult situation,\" Bush said. \"This administration, with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, has created insecurity the likes of which we never would've imagined. There's not a place in the world where we're better off today than six and a half years ago.\"In 2012, the Obama administration renewed full diplomatic ties with Myanmar, which had been an international pariah for more than two decades over the crackdown of its military government on the pro-democracy movement. Obama has visited the country twice as president.This year, Obama renewed relations with Cuba, meeting the country's leader, Raul Castro, at a summit in Panama and officially reopening the U.S. embassy in Havana last month.While many Republicans fiercely oppose the renewal of ties to Myanmar and Cuba, it's clear the official U.S. relationship with those countries is better than when Obama took office, since there was virtually no relationship beforehand.America's diplomatic ties to other countries, including Israel, have been strained under Obama, as Obama has acknowledged in some cases. But it's not accurate to suggest that all U.S. relationships abroad have suffered under Obama.VERDICT: FalseFact check: Carly Fiorina says a Planned Parenthood video shows a \"fully formed fetus on the table, with its heart beating, its legs kicking.\"Carly Fiorina said, \"Anyone who has watched this video tape -- I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\"Fiorina was referring to a video released by the anti-abortion group The Center for Medical Progress last month, in which a former worker for StemExpress, a biomedical research company, said she saw a fully formed fetus's heart beating. .@CarlyFiorina dares @POTUS and @HillaryClinton to watch the #PlannedParenthood videos http://t.co/jcEf6bW9ja http://t.co/uuxke0FHcd\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 17, 2015\"This is the most gestated fetus and closest thing to a baby I've ever seen,\" Holly O'Donnell, a former procurement technician for StemExpress, said in the video. \"I'm sitting here looking at this fetus and its heart is beating and I don't know what to do.\"Carly Fiorina distinguishes herself on debate stage The clip does show what appears to be a fully formed fetus on an operating table with its legs twitching. But the clip Fiorina references is not part of the CMP sting video but was instead taken by another anti-abortion group and was added to the sting video. The Center for Medical Progress, however, doesn't explain where the fetus video was shot, so it's not clear whether it was taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic. For its part, the women's health organization has flatly denied the accusations.VERDICT: True, but misleadingFact check: Chris Christie says he repeatedly defunded Planned Parenthood in New Jersey.New Jersey Gov.

Due to the economic crisis, my Administration was forced to make tough decisions,\" he wrote in a veto statement, trying to address an $11 billion budget shortfall.VERDICT: True, but misleadingFact check: Trump says he never lobbied Bush for casinos in Florida.Bush knocked Trump, saying, \"The one guy that had special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views and was generous and gave me money was Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.\"Trump flatly replied, \"No, I didn't.\" .@JebBush says @realDonaldTrump tried to donate money for casinos http://t.co/jcEf6bW9ja | http://t.co/d0FawuxdwI http://t.co/IuqXfHkb0h\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 17, 2015RELATED: Jeb Bush: The man who killed Trump's casino dreamsBut although Trump himself never personally appealed to Bush for casino gambling in Florida, he had lobbyists do so on his behalf, and he ultimately lost. Trump hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Bush in 1998, shortly before he won office, and gave $50,000 to the Florida Republican Party. But upon taking office, Bush stuck to his stance against gambling and Trump's proposed casino never materialized.VERDICT: FalseFact check: Trump says he never went bankrupt.There have been two comments so far about Trump and bankruptcy: At the prime-time debate, the mogul said he never went bankrupt, hours after former New York Gov. George Pataki said in the earlier debate that every one of Trump's Atlantic City casinos went bust.Trump himself has never filed for personal bankruptcy. But he has filed four business bankruptcies -- Trump Taj Mahal, 1991; Trump Castle Associates, 1992; Trump Hotel & Casino Resort, 2004; and Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009 -- which Bankruptcy.com says makes Trump the top filer in recent decades. All of them were centered around casinos he used to own in Atlantic City. They were all Chapter 11 restructurings, which lets a company stay in business while shedding debt it owes to banks, employees and suppliers.RELATED: Everything you want to know about Donald Trump's bankruptciesTrump claims that successful businesses file for bankruptcy all the time. At the August debate, he said, \"Virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they've used the (bankruptcy) law.\"But the facts don't back up that comment. Fewer than 20% of public companies with assets of $1 billion or more have filed for bankruptcy in the last 30 years, according to data from Bankruptcy.com and S&P Capital IQ.VERDICT: True but misleadingFact check: Lindsey Graham says we need legal immigrant workers in order to replenish the workforce, based on historical ratios of workers to retirees.\"In 1950, there were 16 workers for every retiree. How many are there today? There are three,\" Graham said in the first debate. \"In 20 years, there is going to be two, and you're going to have 80 million Baby Boomers like me retiring en masse, wanting a Social Security check and their Medicare bills paid. We're going to need more legal immigration. Let's make it logical. Let's pick people from all over the world on our terms, not just somebody from Mexico. Let's create a rational, legal immigration system because we have a declining workforce.\"According to Social Security data, in 1950, there were 16.5 covered workers per Social Security beneficiary. In 2014, the latest figures available, there are 2.8, which is lower than Graham's figure. Twenty-five years from now, in 2040, the projection is 2.1. VERDICT: TrueFact check: Bobby Jindal says letting more Syrian refugees into the U.S. would involve a circumvention of the normal immigrant vetting process.\"The answer to this is not to put a Band-Aid on this and allow even more people to come into America,\" Jindal said at the first debate. \"We should not short-circuit the vetting process -- we've got a normal vetting process. Simply allowing more people into our country doesn't solve this problem,\" Jindal said.Actually, the increase the Obama administration is proposing would be managed through the normal process within the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.JUST WATCHEDBobby Jindal: Obama to blame for refugee crisisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBobby Jindal: Obama to blame for refugee crisis 01:05RELATED: U.S. to take at least 10,000 more Syrian refugeesThe 10,000 refugees the administration plans to admit in fiscal year 2016 will follow this multi-step process, which involved registering with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, then undergoing a physical exam, interview and interagency security vetting.Once they've completed this process, the refugees will be referred to approved sponsor agencies in the U.S. that will facilitate their integration into American life.The president of the United States, in consultation with Congress, sets the quota for how many refugees can be admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program at the beginning of each fiscal year, and can change that number mid-year if there is a humanitarian refugee crisis.VERDICT: FalseFollow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "The team rated the claims either: True; Mostly True; True, but Misleading; False; or It's Complicated.The team compared candidate statements against research and reporting", "article_author": "Tom LoBianco, Theodore Schleifer, Laura Koran, Kevin Liptak, Debra Goldschmidt, Amy Roberts, Eve Bower, Mary Davies and Tami Luhby, CNN"}

Gowdy, however, rejected that offer and asked the secretary to appear twice -- once on her exclusive use of a private email server while at State and another in regard to the Benghazi attack.Kendall, who has spearheaded Clinton's communication with the committee, said the former first lady would only testify once on both topics and offered to do it during the week of May 18 or later.The date came and went, however, with no testimony.When it became clear Clinton would have to testify before the committee, her allies and campaign aides had hoped that testimony would happen earlier rather than later in the hopes of not allowing Gowdy to drag the testimony into the heat of the 2016 contest. Clinton's aides, however, have told reporters that they are confident the former senator would be able to hold her own in front of the committee.The top Democrat on the committee, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings, accused Gowdy last week of overstepping the bounds of his committee.\"It appears that much of the Select Committee's work has been shelved while Republicans pursue every possible avenue of political attack against Secretary Clinton,\" Cummings said in a letter to Gowdy. \"These actions by the Select Committee -- which lack any legitimate basis -- serve only to delay its work further into the election season and subject it to increasingly widespread criticism for its highly partisan actions.\"Gowdy has maintained, however, that he is only interested in getting to the bottom of the Benghazi attack and Republicans have complimented him for leaving politics out of it.Clinton's email gained renewed focus on Friday after the inspector general for the intelligence community has informed members of Congress that some material Hillary Clinton emailed from her private server contained classified information, but it was not identified that way when they were sent. Because it was not identified, it is unclear whether Clinton realized she was potentially compromising classified information.The story emboldened Republicans on Friday to call for Clinton to turn over the private email server she used as secretary of state.\"The number of questions surrounding Secretary Clinton's unusual email arrangement continues to grow,\" Gowdy said in a statement on Friday. \"The best -- the only way -- to resolve these important factual questions is for her to turn over her server to the proper authorities for independent forensic evaluation.\"Clinton turned over 55,000 pages of emails to the State Department earlier this year and the Benghazi committee is in the process of going through those messages.Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "Clinton was invited to appear before the committee investigating the Sept. 11, 2012 terrorist attack earlier this weekClinton's supporters argue that the House committee is trying to embarrass the former secretary of state as she runs for president", "article_author": "Dan Merica, CNN"}

Bush said the President \"of course\" has the right to nominate a Supreme Court justice, but added he was certain Obama's pick would not have consensus support.\"The next President needs to appoint someone with a proven conservative record similar to Justice Scalia,\" the former Florida governor said.Marco Rubio hailed Scalia as \"one of the great justices of the history of this republic,\" praising his life-long efforts to defend the \"original meaning of the Constitution.\"But the consensus at the GOP debate hosted by CBS News was short-lived as the candidates spent the next two hours clashing on issues including immigration, foreign policy and the legacy of former President George W. Bush.'Lies'Rubio and Cruz got into a cage match over their records on immigration reform. When asked about his plan to curb illegal immigration, Cruz said there was \"sharp difference on immigration\" between the candidates on stage, before delivering his first punch at Rubio on the issue.\"When Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer and establishment Republicans were leading the fight to pass a massive amnesty plan,\" Cruz said, he was on the side to defeat what he called the \"Rubio-Schumer amnesty plan.\"Rubio accused his Senate colleague of spreading \"lies.\"\"He either wasn't telling the truth then, or isn't telling the truth now,\" Rubio said. \"To argue that he's a purist on immigration is just not truth.\"When Cruz said Rubio has a long record of supporting amnesty and referenced comments he made on Univision, Rubio shot back: \"I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish.\"Cruz quickly responded by speaking in Spanish.Rubio wasn't the only one to call Cruz a liar. Moments later, Trump called the Texas senator \"the single biggest liar.\"\"This guy lied about Ben Carson when he took votes away from Ben Carson in Iowa,\" Trump said, a reference to Cruz allies incorrectly telling voters on the night of the Iowa caucuses that Carson was dropping out of the race.READ: Republican debate: CNN's Reality Check Team inspects the claimsTrump went on to accuse Cruz of running robo-calls in South Carolina informing voters that Trump was not running in this state.\"This is the same thing he did to Ben Carson. This guy will say anything \u2014 nasty guy,\" Trump fumed.Cruz accused Trump of hypocrisy, noting that earlier in the campaign, the businessman had called Carson \"pathological\" and compared the retired neurosurgeon to a child molester.Looking on at his rivals from the edge of the stage, Carson appeared amused by the vicious attacks \u2014 and said he had no intention of joining in the mud slinging.\"So many people have said to me, you need to scream and jump up and down like everybody else,\" Carson said. More than once Tuesday night, Kasich also tried to play a similar role of happy warrior. Voters \"want to see unity and I don't want to get into all this fighting tonight,\" the Ohio governor said. People are \"sick of the negative campaigning.\"Clashing over George W. BushOne of the most electric \u2014 and personally charged\u2014 exchanges of the night took place between Trump and Bush over the legacy of George W. Bush, who will hit the campaign trail in North Charleston on Monday to stump for his brother for the first time.It would prove to be one of several strong moments for Bush Saturday night, in what was easily one of his strongest debate performance of the cycle. Trump started the fight by calling the war that George W. Bush waged in Iraq a \"big fat mistake.\"Jeb Bush hit back strongly, saying, \"I'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems\" he faces. He then turned the fire on Trump: \"While Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security apparatus\" to keep the country safe, he said.Trump lashed back, saying it was under Bush's watch that the World Trade Centers fell on September 11, 2001.\"That's not keeping us safe,\" the New Yorker said, spurring the audience at the Peace Center to boo loudly in disapproval of Trump.Rubio joined in the conversation by coming to George W. Bush's defense.\"He kept us safe and I'm forever grateful,\" the Florida senator said. The terrorist attacks of 2001 happened, Rubio added, because Bill Clinton failed to kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance.Trump's line of attack was clearly intended to remind voters of Bush's family legacy and revive hesitations about installing a political dynasty in the White House. But South Carolina is home to a large number of military personnel and veterans and Trump's critique of the Iraq War could prove risky here.What's at stakeFor Bush, the quest to win South Carolina is personal. The former governor is looking to capitalize on George W. Bush's popularity in the state by bringing the former president out to campaign with him this week. Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina senator who ended his own bid for president in December and endorsed Bush, played the role of surrogate Saturday night as he mingled with reporters in the spin room.Rubio also has reason to hope for a strong showing here. Some of his top campaign aides, including campaign manager Terry Sullivan, are Palmetto State veterans who have been laying the groundwork in the state for months. The Florida senator also earned the endorsement of two prominent members of Congress from this state: Sen. Tim Scott and Rep. Trey Gowdy.The pressure was intense for Rubio, who was rattled by former rival Chris Christie during a memorable moment at the last debate in New Hampshire. But he avoided any gaffes Saturday, and appeared nimble on the debate stage. For Kasich, South Carolina is an uphill battle. The Ohio governor has largely campaigned on a moderate message, and though he is riding high from a second-place finish in New Hampshire this week, appealing to a more conservative base in South Carolina will be a tough task.Carson's path forward is unclear. He briefly topped national polls and was competitive in Iowa, where he appealed to the state's large evangelical constituency. But after a series of missteps and the loss of top campaign staffers, Carson has not been able to regain momentum. As he has in the previous debates, Carson on Saturday used self-deprecating humor to acknowledge that his moment in the spotlight appears to have passed. \"Thank you for including me in the debate,\" he said. \"Two questions already -- this is great.\"", "article_highlights": "GOP candidates discuss whether Obama should nominate Scalia's successorDebate opens with moment of silence to honor Scalia", "article_author": "MJ Lee, CNN Politics Reporter"}

That is a symptom as opposed to the ailment,\" Noble said. \"The larger illness is she is out of touch with middle class voters -- she does have a lifestyle and a history that is about as alien to middle class voters as corporate jets are to a Subaru.\"And activists who are pushing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to challenge Clinton see campaign finance reform as a major issue.\"Being a true champion for working families like Elizabeth Warren is about clearly and unequivocally supporting such critical priorities as a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United,\" said Erica Sagrans, campaign manager for Ready for Warren, a movement dedicated to drafting Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the 2016 race.Clinton's personal involvement with Priorities USA marks the latest chapter in the Democratic Party's evolving relationship with super PACs. Democrats initially fiercely opposed Citizens United. But for all of their rhetoric against super PACs, and as much as the party continues to use the Supreme Court decision as a political rallying cry, over the years political interest has largely won out over progressive idealism.In 2012, President Barack Obama reversed course, declaring after years of keeping his distance from super PACs that his campaign would participate in raising money for Priorities USA.Now that tension is being brought to new heights as the party's next likely presidential nominee personally plans to drum up support for a super PAC backing her candidacy.JUST WATCHEDClinton emails withheld due to top secret contentReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCH (20 Videos)Clinton emails withheld due to top secret contentAnalyst: Democrats 'don't care' about Clinton emailsHillary Clinton responds to latest email controversySenator: Newly released Clinton email 'disturbing'More Benghazi-related emails from Clinton releasedHillary Clinton's explanations of her email sagaBernie Sanders: Americans want the real issuesPataki: Clinton's email server was hacked, secrets stolenClinton: 'Most of my work was not done on emails' Benghazi chairman: We uncovered Clinton's email issueClinton spokesman: Gowdy 'just as bad' for disclosing emailBernie Sanders: People sick of Clinton's 'damn emails'Top Clinton aide testifies at Benghazi hearingTech worker speaks out in Clinton email scandalFact-checking a Hillary Clinton email claimHillary Clinton on emails: 'I'm sorry'Hillary Clinton: I regret email server controversyFact-checking Hillary Clinton's subpoena claimHillary Clinton on how 33,000 emails got deletedHow easy is it to setup a private email server?RELATED: Bush and Clinton confront family legaciesClinton allies also see that her fundraising prowess and the depth of her connections with the kinds of donors who can cut multi-million dollar checks will likely make her a formidable competitor against any Republican candidate she may face in the general election. Officials are careful to emphasize, however, that Clinton and everyone else involved with her campaign will strictly follow the law as they solicit funds for Priorities USA.The 2016 money race is well underway on the other side of the political aisle. Declared GOP candidates including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as expected candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, are on a fundraising tear. And they've shown no signs of distancing themselves from super PAC money. Cruz launched his campaign in March, and the senator's allies declared that an affiliated network of pro-Cruz super PACs had raised upwards of $30 million in just a matter of days. The stiff competition against Republican money is a reality that some progressive leaders say they cannot ignore.Former Vermont governor and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said it would be unwise for Clinton to reject super PAC money. \"Unfortunately, if you don't play by the same rules everybody else does, you end up losing elections,\" said Dean, founder of Democracy for America, one of the groups behind the draft Warren movement. \"The key is to change the rules, and I think we have a much better chance of doing that with her as president than we do with one of the Republicans.\" 6 photos: Who's running for president?Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders, John Kasich, Ted Cruz,Donald Trump and Marco Rubio Hide Caption 1 of 66 photos: Who's running for president?Businessman Donald Trump announced June 16 at his Trump Tower in New York City that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination.

Kerry mentioned a potential new total as high as 100,000, as well as other possible maximum numbers, according to the aide.In all, about 1,500 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the United States since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, the vast majority of them this fiscal year.Here's a breakdown: 23 in 2011, 41 in 2012, 45 in 2013, 249 in 2014 and 1,199 so far this fiscal year, which ends September 30, according to the State Department figures as of September 4.About 300 more refugees are expected to be admitted by the end of this fiscal year. This equates to a grand total of about 1,800 refugees from Syria's four-year civil war being admitted to the United States by October 1, according to U.S. officials.Human rights groups have called on the U.S. to accept 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of next year. Last spring, Democratic lawmakers wrote to Obama asking him to \"significantly increase\" the number of Syrians permitted to resettle in the U.S.Kerry and Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees and Migration Ann Richard told lawmakers that they could come back to seek congressional agreement, or an \"emergency exception\" to bring in more refugees, a source familiar with the meeting said. A congressional aide said Kerry suggested he could return to Congress to ask for their support for admitting as many as 30,000 more refugees.\"We are looking hard at the number that we can specifically manage with respect to the crisis in Syria and Europe,\" he said after the meeting. \"That's being vetted fully right now.\"A senior State Department official briefing reporters said there were \"varying views among lawmakers present at the meeting about accepting more refugees.\" The official said Kerry proposed \"a range of different numbers.\"\"The thinking all along this year was we could move to increase it, some sort of a modest increase,\" the official said. \"Given what's going on in the world today, I know that there's a lot of people outside the administration, and inside the administration, too, in very senior positions, who would like to increase it significantly.\"Syrian refugees: Which countries welcome them, which ones don'tThe official added: \"The question becomes, will Congress support that? Can we move this process that we have, that doesn't turn on a dime, to start bringing larger numbers sooner? That's hard.\"The official added the main objective of the resettlement program was to ensure refuges admitted to the United States return home once the conflict ends, which was difficult to do when they were resettled so far from home.In a statement after the meeting, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, expressed his concerns.While he said Kerry was seeking a \"reasonable increase\" in refugees allowed into the U.S. for the coming year, referring to the 5,000 figure, he added that \"when pressed, the administration indicated that they were considering opening the floodgates and using emergency authority to go above what they proposed to Congress in today's consultation.\"He continued, \"Before agreeing to accept tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, the Obama administration must prove to the American people that it will take the necessary precautions to ensure that national security is a top priority, especially at a time when ruthless terrorist groups like ISIS are committed to finding ways to enter the United States and harm Americans.\"Vetting the Syrian refugees has been a problem. The U.S. relies on U.N. lists of refugees who are deemed safe candidates for resettlement, but the screening process can take between 18 and 24 months and strains the resources of the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Immigration Services.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday that the current migration is a \"disaster of biblical proportions\" that poses an opportunity for terrorist groups such as ISIS to \"infiltrate operatives among these refugees.\"\"What we're trying to do is weed out people who are liars, who are criminals or would-be terrorists,\" a senior State Department official said.JUST WATCHEDRefugee gives birth, carries newborn on 11-day walkReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRefugee gives birth, carries newborn on 11-day walk 02:17\"I believe that the President has made it clear he wants the United States -- which has always taken a leadership role with respect to humanitarian issues and particularly refugees -- to be able to do what we can,\" Kerry told reporters after his meeting with senators Wednesday.\"We are committed to increasing the number of refugees we take and we are looking hard at the number we can specifically manage with respect to the crisis in Syria and Europe and their migration today,\" Kerry said.Kerry's meeting is part of an annual discussion the administration has with Congress to set its refugee admissions quota for the next fiscal year.But while the meeting is routine, it comes at a time when unprecedented international attention is being paid to the issue of refugee resettlement.More than half the population of Syria has been displaced by the ongoing civil war, and the flow of refugees in the Middle East and Europe has put a strain on countries' resources and divided local populations.The United States has accepted just over 1,500 refugees from the crisis so far, the vast majority of them in the past year.The rate of admissions is growing, but the U.S. is limited in how quickly it can resettle refugees because of both admissions quotas and security concerns.On Tuesday, State Department spokesman John Kirby said the administration's response to the crisis would need to be balanced against \"the proper vetting procedures to make sure that, particularly when we're bringing in people from that part of the world, that we're doing it safely and securely.\"Congressional Republicans in particular have raised alarm bells for months over the possibility that Syrian extremists -- including ISIS sympathizers -- could enter country by pretending to be refugees, potentially committing attacks against the homeland.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated information about Rep.

I think she took full advantage of it -- she is going to move up in the polls as a result,\" Axelrod said.Fiorina's one uncomfortable moment came when Trump eviscerated her record as CEO.

She's already two-thirds of the way to a triple crown of debate wins. But can she now make a real run at the nomination?It's not just about The DonaldFor the first time in several months, the GOP race did not revolve around Trump. The billionaire opened the debate with a brutal assault on fellow candidate Rand Paul, a Kentucky senator, but failed to dominate the showdown as much as many pundits expected. He held his own, and true to form hit back hard when attacked.But as the debate moved into a thicket of issues, especially foreign policy, the advantage of Trump's flamboyant, fill-every-room personality seemed to erode.Early on, Trump raised his eyebrows and held up a finger to demand entry into the fray. But as the clash went into a third hour, he seemed to mellow. He even slapped palms with arch-foe Bush at one point and gave Ben Carson a tap on the elbow when the retired neurosurgeon didn't castigate him over a waffling answer about discredited links between vaccinations and autism.JUST WATCHEDHighlights of the Bush/Trump SplitscreenReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHHighlights of the Bush/Trump Splitscreen 01:36Trump, who has shocked pundits with his barnstorming rise to the top of the polls, probably didn't disappoint his fervent anti-establishment army. But the fact that his bombast didn't command the stage may prompt voters who have not followed the race closely to wonder what the fuss was about. Former Mitt Romney spokesman and CNN analyst Kevin Madden said Trump had given other campaigns an opening.\"They saw him like a boxer who has finally bled for the first time,\" he said.Trump's most awkward moment came when he tried to make it up to Fiorina over his harsh comments about her face in Rolling Stone magazine.\"I think she has got a beautiful face and I think she is a beautiful woman,\" Trump said.

But office holders like Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul along with sitting governors like Chris Christie showed they can bring it, too.Rubio, a Florida senator, made up for a slow start with fluent discussions on foreign policy, lacerating Obama over turmoil in the Middle East, and appeared to win an exchange with Trump on national security by deploying a mastery of detail and a sweeping global mission that the front-runner failed to command.15 photos: Republican debates: The main event15 photos: Republican debates: The main eventRepublican presidential candidates stand on stage before the main debate Wednesday, September 16, at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.

Christie might have done himself the most good. The blunt-talking New Jersey governor was supposed to be the bully in the field, but Trump stole his schtick. So Christie tried a different tack, asking for the camera to be turned to the audience in his opening statement to symbolize it was not in fact \"all about me.

Bush also scored when he demanded an apology from Trump for comments he made about his wife and had a human moment when he admitted to smoking pot 40 years ago.Yet he is not the establishment giant pundits had expected to see at the start of the race. He used a question on his preferred Secret Service codename to hit back at Trump's claims that he's running a \"low-energy campaign,\" quipping that he would be known as the high-powered battery \"Eveready.\" But it's not clear that viewers agree with him. 11 is a crowdIt might have been the night when conservative gushing about the quality of the 2016 field was justified. None of the candidates -- even the political novices -- committed a clear gaffe. Several shone. But with an unwieldy field of 11 in the top-tier debate, even a three-hour conversation didn't provide enough time for everyone to show what they can do.Cruz, a Texas senator, had a flurry of good moments -- talking especially to his core constituency of evangelical voters -- and made a strong case against what he said was a \"catastrophic\" nuclear deal. Similarly, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee was preaching to the converted when he stood up for Kentucky court clerk Kim Davis, who refused to issue same-sex marriage licenses. He said Muslims at Guantanamo Bay got accommodations for their faith while a Christian women from Kentucky didn't.

Carson, the neurosurgeon who has shot nearly to the top of the polls, was his normal polite self. But his difficulty in coming out of his shell might have hurt him as he failed to stand out. Wisconsin Gov.

On style in recent weeks, Bush and Clinton couldn't have less in common. The two are, more than any other candidates in the 2016 field, comfortable talking about anything and everything. But Bush's exchanges have included questions from reporters at many of his events, while Clinton has \u2014 by the most generous count \u2014 taken a total of 13 questions since entering the race, and hasn't sat for any interviews. Take Chipotle: Clinton was discovered on a closed-circuit security feed in one of the restaurants only after she'd been there. Bush talked with reporters in New Hampshire about the local franchise in Miami, and how he really likes to cook up his own Mexican food at home. Still, Bush has insisted that he's not yet actually a candidate \u2014 that he's still in an exploratory phase. And neither Bush nor Clinton have detailed the policy underpinnings of their campaigns.Bush appeared unprepared this week to answer one of the most obvious questions his candidacy would face: With the benefit of hindsight, was the Iraq war a mistake? He was confronted Wednesday in a town hall meeting in Nevada by a voter who didn't care for Bush's insistence that questions such as those are hypothetical and therefore shouldn't be answered. The Reno man's point: The entire exercise of running for president is answering one big hypothetical question. In Tempe, Arizona on Thursday, Bush had had enough. \"Knowing what we now know, I would not have engaged \u2014 I would not have gone into Iraq,\" he said. 21 photos: Jeb Bush's lifeFormer Florida Gov.

Former George W. Bush White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the Bush family legacy is \"something that will follow [Jeb Bush] throughout his campaign\" \u2014 but that the Iraq war issue, while a \"difficult phase,\" won't cause long-term damage. \"It was your classic stumble,\" Fleischer said. \"Every candidate will have one or two. The good candidates only have one or two. The candidates who get into trouble have many.\" The Democratic National Committee unsurprisingly took a much harsher view, saying Bush's inability to separate himself from his brother on such an obvious issue was a game-changer.\"We got a long, hard look at what a Jeb foreign policy would look like, and here's the real shocker: It would look a lot like his brother's,\" said Arizona Democratic Party chair Alexis Tameron. WATCH: The Bush family and IraqThe most pressing issue Clinton faces \u2014 free trade \u2014 is a bigger problem than Bush's, Fleischer said, because Clinton's unwillingness to stake out a firm position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and related legislation recall her 2008 campaign, in which Clinton appeared most interested in avoiding controversy. Today, Obama is pushing Democrats to adopt his position in support of the trade deal, while Clinton hasn't commented on the pact publicly beyond tepid statements since entering the race.\"This is your classic tale of a politician who isn't strong enough to take a strong stand. That can dog you,\" Fleischer said. \"That's why I think an issue like this, which is less sensational, can be more damaging,\" he said. \"Because it's about a governing mindset, and her governing mindset is to find whichever position is most convenient in whatever time she's in.\" For Clinton, her refusal to answer questions has left pressure building, making her every utterance more combustible. That much was evident when it was Bill Clinton, during a visit to Africa, who was answering questions about his wife's presidential campaign platform, while the former secretary of state kept a quiet public schedule this week. Clinton did privately address trade in a private meeting with donors Thursday in Brooklyn. Former Sen. Evan Bayh offered the details afterward, telling a small group of reporters that Clinton \"gave the answer you're familiar with: She said 'look I want to see what the proposed agreement is before expressing an opinion on it. We need to reap the benefits and at the same time ... help the people who would be adversely affected.'\" Democrats who support Clinton doubt that her handling of the press matters much at this stage with the election more than a year and a half away, and most voters not tuned in. They offer an alternative view: Clinton's refusal to wade into the fight of the moment shows that she's learned from 2008 and is now much more able to stay focused on the messages most important to her. Bayh said Clinton is in fact running a campaign that better mirrors her this time. \"There's something in some ways about being unsuccessful that can be liberating,\" the former Indiana governor and senator said. \"She didn't have to run. She's focused on the fact that it's really not about her, it's about where the country needs to go.

Because in my years in the Senate, I've figured out very quickly that the political establishment in Washington, D.C. in both political parties is completely out of touch with the lives of our people,\" Rubio said. \"That's why I'm missing votes. Because I am leaving the Senate, I'm not running for re-election, and I'm running for president because I know this: unless we have the right president, we cannot make America fulfill its potential, but with the right person in office, the 21st century can be the greatest era that our nation has ever known.\"Most awkward moments of the debateJeb BushBush stood out with several key moments during the debate that reassured his supporters after recently dipping in the polls and grappling with how to handle Trump's staying power in the race.Bush appeared to come out of the shell of the tortoise he has so heartily embraced as his symbol to give voters a taste of the passion he has struggled to showcase.\"You know what? As it relates to my brother, there's one thing I know for sure. He kept us safe,\" Bush told Trump to one of his strongest applause moments of the night. \"You remember the fire fighter with his arms around it? He sent a clear signal that the United States would be strong and fight Islamic terrorism, and he did keep us safe.\" And he also successfully tackled Trump over the billionaire's suggestion that Bush's Mexican-American wife was the reason for his support for comprehensive immigration reform.\"To subject my wife into the middle of a raucous political conversation was completely inappropriate, and I hope you apologize for that, Donald,\" Bush said. \"Why don't you apologize to her right now.\" Trump declined. 15 photos: Republican debates: The main event15 photos: Republican debates: The main eventRepublican presidential candidates stand on stage before the main debate Wednesday, September 16, at the Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California.

On the same hand, I think that will haunt him in the long term because I think tying himself to his brother's legacy is bad in the long run.\"On Thursday morning, Carpenter said the former Florida governor should have been more forceful in demanding an apology from Trump for comments that real estate developer had made about Bush's wife in the past. \"He could have been stronger and I think a lot of women were thinking that,\" she said on CNN.Candidates pick their Secret Service code namesChris ChristieWhile Bush and Fiorina milked their standout moments from their tiffs with Trump, the New Jersey governor snagged his by using a key moment to make his opponents look narcissistic and portrayed himself the adult in the room.\"While I'm as entertained as anyone by this personal back-and-forth about the history of Donald and Carly's career, for the 55-year-old construction worker out in that audience tonight who doesn't have a job, who can't fund his child's education, I've got to tell you the truth. They could care less about your careers, they care about theirs,\" Christie said. \"Let's start talking about that on this stage and stop playing -- and stop playing the games.\"Earlier in the night, Christie suggested the problem with the debate was \"we're fighting with each other up here\" over how to approach defunding Planned Parenthood even though \"we agree.\" And that's when Christie -- who's been accused of being too moderate -- gave his best performance yet to prove his conservative credentials.\"She (Hillary Clinton) believes in the systematic murder of children in the womb to preserve their body parts...in the way that maximizes their value for sale for profit,\" Christie said.5 memorable moments from the debateUnclearDonald TrumpTrump faced a barrage of attacks from a field of contenders clearly more prepared, and eager, to take on the brash billionaire. Those who pulled punches in the last debate -- like Scott Walker and Jeb Bush -- didn't hesitate to tackle Trump, eager to regain their faltering standings in the polls. The result was mixed as Trump had both memorable highlights and cringe-worthy lowlights. But as the front-runner trying to hold on to the lead as retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson's numbers grow, it's difficult to see how Trump wasn't at least partially wounded by Thursday's performance. Trump stumbled in responding to Fiorina's deft answer to his comments about her face, awkwardly calling her \"beautiful\" after suggesting her looks would keep Americans from voting for her.Former Bush aide and CNN political commentator Ana Navarro spoke highly of the move. \"I thought it was brilliant, because he surprised us all with his answer,\" she said on CNN. \"He shut it down.\"And when Bush attacked him for a \"lack of judgment\" and \"lack of understanding about how the world works,\" Trump resorted to an oft-used tactic of tying Bush to his brother's presidency suggesting that \"your brother's administration gave us Barack Obama because it was such a disaster ... that Abraham Lincoln couldn't have been elected.\" Bush's quick answer -- that his brother kept the country safe -- knocked Trump off balance as the crowd roared in approval. Trump's stamina tested in GOP debateHowever, Trump hit his high notes when he was on the offensive, delivering some of the standard fare that his supporters likely devoured. He said he never attacked Sen. Rand Paul on his looks though \"there's plenty of subject matter right there\" -- and he took on both Fiorina and Walker's records with numbers to back his rhetoric. JUST WATCHEDBest Trump zingers of the CNN Republican debateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBest Trump zingers of the CNN Republican debate 01:28And as he faced questions over foreign policy and his flubbed response to conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, who was one of the debate's questioners, Trump smartly pivoted to Hewitt, insulating himself from further attacks from his rivals.Trump managed to escape the main question over his knowledge of various terrorist groups and their leaders by pointing out that Hewitt had recently conceded to a misunderstanding between the two when Hewitt spoke of the Quds Forces, which Trump misheard as \"Kurds\" -- leading to crosstalk between the two, not between Trump and a fellow candidate.Conservative analyst Mercedes Schlapp said Trump was silent for more than 30 minutes of discussion n serious policy issues. \"There was a point when he was speechless,\" she said. \"You could tell he was so uncomfortable talking about any of the issues except for immigration.\"Odds of Trump nomination drop after debateJohn KasichThere wasn't much daylight between the Ohio governor's first and second debate performances.But Kasich's second performance lacked the umpf that defined his first appearance on the debate stage when he barely squeaked into the top-tier and impressed political observers just weeks after launching his candidacy.Fact-checking the candidatesLosersRand PaulPaul continued to throw things at the wall on Wednesday -- still nothing appeared to stick. The libertarian-leaning senator from Kentucky once again went for Trump's jugular. When he was asked whether he would trust Trump with the nuclear codes, Paul gave a firm answer: absolutely not.But with each attack, Paul failed to do what candidates must do to break out in a debate: Pivot to his own strengths. Instead he simply pointed out Trump's weaknesses.Paul's strongest moments came when he defended his libertarian point of view on foreign military interventions and drug and criminal justice reform. But while those audiences likely played well to his libertarian base of support, Paul appeared the odd one out as he discussed foreign policy amid a field of foreign policy hawks. Scott WalkerWalker came out swinging at the start of the debate, clearly eager to take on the front-runner after dipping in the polls in recent weeks off a strategy that largely avoided confronting Trump.\"We don't need an apprentice in the White House. We have one there right now,\" Walker said of Trump in what was clearly a prepared zinger -- one that drew an approving nod from Bush. Walker then took on Trump's attacks about his tenure as governor and then defended his opposition to the minimum wage, but soon faded from the stage.He delivered his responses with more zeal in a performance that topped his first debate night, but didn't come away from the night with any breakout moments that may prove necessary as Walker looks to regain his footing in the race.Graphic: Who attacked whom at the debate?Ben CarsonThe second Republican debate was all Carson's for the taking: the retired neurosurgeon's appearance comes off a recent surge that has rocketed him to the No. 2 spot in the race.But instead, Carson played it safe, clinging to his calm and measured demeanor, avoiding the food fights unfolding alongside him and injecting his trademark good humor into his responses. 16 photos: 16 photos: Hide Caption 1 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 2 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 3 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 4 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 5 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 6 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 7 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 8 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 9 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 10 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 11 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 12 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 13 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 14 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 15 of 1616 photos: Hide Caption 16 of 16It wasn't for a lack of opportunities: Carson got several openings to knock Trump, but refused, even when Trump put forward some sketchy scientific backing for his views on vaccines.A few zingers could have delivered the bump Carson needs to overtake Trump in at least one of the early states where he has been slowly catching up to the billionaire front-runner.But Carson may get there anyway: his unorthodox appeal on Wednesday shied away from the spotlight-charging moments that often define presidential debates -- not unlike his first debate performance.Mike Huckabee & Ted CruzWhile both delivered solid responses to the questions they received, neither former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee nor Texas Sen. Ted Cruz seized opportunities to stand out on the crowded 11-candidate stage.They didn't want to take on Trump and both revealed an unwillingness to engage their fellow candidates on key policy issues.The result? They faded into the background.Candidates repeatedly attempted to distance themselves from the Beltway and paint themselves as anti-establishment, said former Obama aide David Axelrod.\"So Washington was a big loser in this debate for sure,\" said Axelrod, a CNN senior political commentator.6 takeaways from the debateFollow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "Big winners for the night include: Carly Fiorina, Marco Rubio and Chris ChristieLess clear is how Wednesday's performance will affect the campaigns of Jeb Bush and Ben Carson", "article_author": "Jeremy Diamond, CNN"}

Jeb Bush accused Donald Trump of using inappropriate language, Trump retorted that \"nobody reports\" that Bush said \"two days ago\" that he \"would take his pants off and moon everybody, and that's fine.\" Not exactly.In an interview a week ago with The Boston Globe, Bush expressed frustration with his lack of press coverage in recent months.\"I could drop my pants,\" he told the paper. \"Moon the whole crowd. Everybody would be aghast, except the press guys would never notice.\"The comment by Bush was obviously reported -- it was made in a newspaper interview. And it was not \"two days ago\" -- the interview was published on Feb. 6, 2016.Bush was not saying he planned to moon the crowd, but rather speaking rhetorically and saying that even if he did, it would not garner media coverage. Verdict: False.Reality Check: Trump claims he opposed Iraq WarBy Laura Koran, CNNTrump said, \"I'm the only one on this stage that said do not go into Iraq. Do not attack Iraq. Nobody else on this stage said that. I said it loud and strong. And I was in the private sector. I wasn't a politician, fortunately, but I said it, and I said it loud and clear, you'll destabilize the Middle East. That's exactly what happened.\"Trump often touts the claim hat he objected to the war in Iraq in the early days. But while he may have held that view, the notion he said so \"loud and strong\" in the lead-up to the war has been cast in doubt.The Washington Post seems to have the earliest quote from him on the subject. Trump told the paper at a 2003 Oscars after-party days after the invasion that \"the war's a mess.\"He was more vehement in an August 2004 Esquire Magazine interview, saying of the invasion: \"I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon.\"Trump has also tweeted the link to a July 2004 Reuters article titled \"Donald Trump Would 'Fire' Bush Over Iraq Invasion\" to emphasize his opposition.But these statements were made after the war began, mostly in 2004. There's no indication he said anything along the lines of \"Do not attack Iraq,\" before the invasion began, as he claims.Verdict: False.Reality Check: Trump on Social Security recipients older than 106By Tami Luhby, CNNMoneyAsked how he would fix Social Security, Trump said he would eliminate waste, fraud and abuse. He noted that the Social Security Administration has many centenarians on its rolls.\"We have in Social Security right now thousands and thousands of people that are over 106 years old. Now, you know they don't exist. They don't exist. There's tremendous waste, fraud, and abuse, and we're going to get it,\" Trump said.Actually, the Social Security Administration has 6.5 million people over the age of 112 with Social Security numbers but no dates of death, according to a Social Security's Office of the Inspector General report from March 2015.\"This missing death information could result in erroneous payments made by federal benefit-paying agencies that rely on the DMF (Death Master File) to detect inaccurate or unreported deaths. The missing death information will also hinder private industry as well as state and local governments' ability to identify and prevent identity fraud,\" the report said.However, \"almost none of these number-holders remained in current payment status,\" the inspector general said. So correcting the record likely won't save Social Security much money and help keep the system solvent.Many politicians like to say they'll fix the federal government's problems by eliminating waste, fraud and abuse. But experts say not only is that very difficult to do, but it probably won't make a big dent in solving the nation's fiscal issues.Verdict: It is true that there are many very elderly people in the Social Security database, but false that he could address the program's financial shortfall by removing them.Jeb BushReality Check: Obama blames George Bush for Iraq problemsBy Sonam Vashi, CNNIn response to Trump, who said that President George W. Bush knew there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, Jeb Bush said, \"So here's the deal. I'm sick and tired of Barack Obama blaming my brother for all of the problems that he's had.\"We found several instances that Obama has blamed the Bush administration for problems in Iraq.First, a little background: in 2008, Bush reluctantly signed the Status of Forces argument, which set a December 2011 deadline for the withdrawal of troops in Iraq. While Obama had three years to work toward a new agreement to possibly delay that withdrawal, negotiations hit a wall over the issue of ensuring that U.S. military personnel would be granted immunity from criminal proceedings.In August 2014, at a press conference on ISIS amid the Mount Sinjar siege, a reporter asked whether the President had any second thoughts about his decision to pull ground troops out of Iraq. Obama responded, \"What I just find interesting is the degree to which this issue keeps on coming up, as if this was my decision. Under the previous administration, we had turned over the country to a sovereign, democratically elected Iraqi government. In order for us to maintain troops in Iraq, we needed the invitation of the Iraqi government ... And the Iraqi government, based on its political considerations, in part because Iraqis were tired of a U.S. occupation, declined to provide us those assurances.\"And again, last June, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest responded to a question about whether Obama should accept responsibility for ISIS' rise. Earnest said, \"(al Qaeda in Iraq) didn't exist until the United States had invaded Iraq in the first place, under the leadership of the previous administration. What's also true is that out of the remnants of the defeated (al Qaeda) sprang ISIL. And the primary responsibility for that actually lies at the feet of Prime Minister Maliki, who failed to govern Iraq in an inclusive way, but rather, because of his failed leadership, allowed sectarian divisions to emerge and weaken that country and create an environment where ISIL was able to make surprising and significant gains across the countryside.\" While the President hasn't placed the blame fully on Bush, it's clear that Obama has blamed the Bush administration for many of the problems in Iraq. We'll leave it up to our readers to decide which president truly deserves the blame for the situation in Iraq, but in the meantime, we're rating Jeb Bush's claim as mostly true.Reality Check: Bush on job creation record in FloridaBy Chip Grabow, CNNWhen the topic turned to the economy, Bush bragged about his job creation record while serving eight years as governor of Florida. Bush said the $19 billion in tax cuts he approved \"stimulated seven out of the eight years (and) Florida led the nation in job growth.\" So what is Bush's job creation record during his term from January 1999 to January 2007? According to Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida, Bush created 1.3 million jobs. When Bush's term ended, Florida's unemployment rate was 3.4%, below the national rate then of 4.4%. As CNN Money previously reported, Bush privatized many government jobs and the state was flush with job growth during his term.A look at Bureau of Labor Statistics data confirms Bush's claim. For non-farm jobs, from 2000 to 2007 (seven of eight years of Bush's term), Florida led the nation in job growth, creating 1.1 million new jobs. In 1999, however, California led the nation, creating 1.48 million jobs compared with Florida's 1.33 million.Based on that BLS data, we rate Bush's claim as true.Ted CruzReality Check: Cruz on arming the KurdsBy Marshall Cohen, CNNAsked about his strategy to fight ISIS, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said the Kurds would play a key role.\"They are fighting ISIS right now, they are winning victories right now,\" Cruz said. \"ISIS is using American military equipment they've seized in Iraq, and the Obama administration refuses to arm the Kurds, the Peshmerga, fighting forces who have been longtime allies. We ought to be arming them and letting them fight.\"The Kurds are an ethnic group that is spread across parts of Iraq, Syria, Turkey and Iran. They've emerged as one of the most effective and organized fighting forces that have directly engaged ISIS in northern Iraq and Syria. But contrary to Cruz's claim, they've done it with assistance from the United States.Iraqi Kurds do receive weapons and equipment from the Pentagon, indirectly channeled through the central Iraqi government in Baghdad because of sovereignty issues. In addition to that assistance, CNN reported in 2014 that the CIA was covertly providing arms directly to Iraqi Kurdish forces.On the Syrian side, the U.S. does not provide weapons to Kurdish forces there. But the U.S. does provide weapons and ammunition to some opposition groups comprised of Sunni Arabs. And those groups coordinate with the Syrian Kurds, under the umbrella of the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces.So, what's the bottom line? Cruz said the U.S. \"refuses to arm the Kurds,\" and that is clearly not true.Verdict: False.Reality Check: Cruz on percentage of Americans workingBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoneyCruz repeated his claim that \"we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today in any year since 1977.\"Last month, 59.6% of Americans aged 16 and older were employed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's higher than it was in 1977, when it ranged from 57% to 58.7%.In one of January's debates, Cruz voiced the claim in response to a question about whether America's economy is as strong as President Barack Obama said it was in his State of the Union address. The share of Americans employed during Obama's terms has ranged from as low as 58.2% in mid-2011 to as high as 60.6% when Obama took office in January 2009.Since 1977, the highest share of employed Americans was in April 2000, when 64.7% had a job.However, the overall percentage of adults who are working isn't the best measure since the number of retirees is growing as the nation ages. So let's look at the share of prime working age adults (ages 25 to 54) who are employed. Some 77.7% of these Americans were employed in January, compared to between 71% and 72.8% in 1977.By no measure is the share of Americans employed at its lowest point since 1977.Verdict: False. Reality Check: Cruz on Trump and DemocratsBy Sonam Vashi, CNNCruz cited a laundry list of Democrats that he said Trump had supported. \"And you know how I know that Donald's Supreme Court justices will be liberals?\" Cruz asked. \"Because his entire life he supported liberals from Jimmy Carter to Hillary Clinton to John Kerry. In 2004, he contributed to John Kerry. Nobody who cares about judges would contribute to John Kerry, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Harry Reid. That's what Donald Trump has done.\"Let's go through them.Trump has supported Clinton. He donated to Clinton and the Clinton Foundation in the mid-2000s.He also gave $2,000 to Kerry, now the secretary of state, in 2004 and $4,000 to Schumer, a Democratic New York senator, in 2010, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Trump also donated $4,800 in 2010 to Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nevada, just some of the $10,400 he's given to Reid in total. But as for Jimmy Carter? The 39th president said he'd pick Trump over Cruz a couple of weeks ago, and Trump said Carter had \"good taste.\" But previous to that, Carter has said that Trump's comments were \"very stupid\" and Trump has said that Carter was \"incompetent.\" We can't find any real evidence of support by Trump for Carter ... especially since Trump accidentally said that Carter was dead in 2014.Verdict: Mostly true.Reality Check: Cruz on tax planBy Lisa Rose, CNNCruz delivered an expansive description of his tax plan during the debate. He left a few details out, however. We'll take this point by point.First, he declared his plan for a 16% business flat tax is not comparable to a value added tax, a tax on businesses and consumer spending. \"The business flat tax is not a sales tax,\" Cruz said. \"It is a tax of 16% imposed fairly and evenly across the board on all businesses.\"The Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning think tank, has described Cruz's business flat tax as a close cousin of the VAT tax, built into the cost of goods and services rather than added on a transactional basis like sales taxes. The broad based tax could lead to price hikes that will hurt lower-income Americans and small businesses, according to an analysis by Forbes. Next, the Texas senator said he will abolish corporate income taxes, payroll taxes and the estate tax (or \"the death tax,\" in Cruz parlance). He also stated he will end the penalties associated with not signing up for the Affordable Care Act. The Tax Foundation acknowledged Cruz's cuts could add $3.6 trillion to the national debt over 10 years.Lastly, Cruz said his plan will \"produce 4.9 million new jobs ... increase capital investment by 44% and ... lift everyone's incomes by double digits.\" He gets those numbers, again, from the Tax Foundation. When the group analyzed Cruz's plan, it crunched the numbers using a \"dynamic\" model that speculates tax cuts will give the whole economy a boost. The Tax Foundation's calculation hinged on the assumption that tax cuts will add $2.8 trillion to the economy, according to the Washington Post.Cruz described the Tax Foundation as \"nonpartisan.\" Google suggests otherwise. The group is affiliated with conservative billionaires, Charles and David Koch. Its website contains such headlines as \"Lefties Attack Paul Ryan for Bringing Reality to Budgeting.\"While the senator accurately recited the Tax Foundation's overall findings, he failed to mention a few trillion-dollar caveats, or the definite political bent of what he called a non-partisan organization. Verdict: True, but misleading.Marco RubioReality Check: Rubio on Russia occupying 20% of GeorgiaBy Ryan Browne, CNN National Security ProducerIn discussing Russian President Vladimir Putin's actions in Eastern Europe, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said that Russia controlled significant territory in Georgia and Ukraine.Rubio said: \"Rebuilding and reinvigorating NATO in the European theater, particularly in Central Europe, in Eastern Europe where Vladimir Putin is now threatening the territory of multiple countries, already controls 20% of Georgia and a significant percentage of Ukraine.\"Rubio is referring to the Georgian provinces of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The area of both provinces is about 18.2% of overall Georgian territory.In the early 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and formation of the independent Republic of Georgia, secessionists in Abkhazia and South Ossetia fought battles with the central Georgian government in a bid to obtain independence.While the fighting eventually ended in a ceasefire, the separatists maintained their own autonomous and unrecognized governments.In August 2008, then-Georgia President Mikheil Saakashvili sent troops to regain control over the Russian-backed self-proclaimed autonomous region. Russia responded by intervening and sent thousands of troops into South Ossetia and invaded Georgian territory, threatening the capital of Tbilisi.During the five-day conflict, nearly 200 Georgian military personnel and 228 civilians were killed. Sixty-seven Russian servicemen and 365 South Ossetian militia members and civilians also lost their lives.Russia recognized the two provinces as independent countries soon after but only three other countries have followed suit.Russia maintains troops in both regions, and in 2009, assumed control of the South Ossetia-Russia border. In 2011, the European Union's parliament passed a resolution that labeled the Russian presence as an \"occupying force.\"Verdict: True.Reality Check: Rubio on 'lame duck' presidents making Supreme Court nominationsBy Will Cadigan, CNNDuring an opening round of questions that focused on the passing of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and his successor's potential effect on the political landscape leading up to the 2016 election, Rubio said \"It's been over 80 years since a lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court justice.\"The definition of what makes a president a \"lame duck\" varies, but it is generally considered to be a president who is in the final period of their term and is not eligible to run for re-election.Rubio is right that no president who fits a narrow description of a \"lame duck\" has appointed a justice to the Supreme Court in the past 80 years. However, President Ronald Reagan nominated Anthony Kennedy on Nov 30, 1987, and he was confirmed on Feb 3, 1988 -- the last two years of Reagan's final term. Whether that constitutes as \"lame duck\" is up for debate.In addition, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt successfully nominated Frank Murphy to the court in 1940, an election year that was the final one of his second term.Why was this not a \"lame duck\" appointment? Roosevelt at the time was running for (and eventually won) a third term as president, the only commander in chief to ever do so.The 22nd Amendment, passed in 1951, established the two-term limit for the presidency and created the \"lame duck\" period that we know today.That being said, in 1968, President Lyndon Johnson was a \"lame duck\" and unsuccessfully nominated Abe Fortas to serve as chief justice and Homer Thornberry to fill Fortas' seat on the court. Fortas' nomination was filibustered in the Senate and eventually withdrawn. Thornberry's nomination was withdrawn as well as there was no vacancy left to be filled.Rubio's time frame of \"80 years\" seems to be a nod to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley's statement on Scalia's death in which he said, \"The fact of the matter is that it's been standard practice over the last nearly 80 years that Supreme Court nominees are not nominated and confirmed during a presidential election year.\"So depending on your definition of \"lame duck,\" Rubio is mostly correct. No lame duck president has appointed a Supreme Court Justice in the last 80 years, but the \"lame duck presidency\" has only existed for 65 years.Verdict: Mostly true.Ted Cruz & Marco RubioCruz and Rubio engaged in a rapid-fire exchange over immigration, and chock full of claims from both candidates. CNN's Reality Check Team teased out three important claims.Reality Check: Cruz on Rubio and executive actions on amnestyBy Eve Bower, CNNCruz said that, as president, he would \"rescind every single illegal executive action\" Obama has issued. He implied that one he specifically intended to rescind was a 2012 executive action that granted relief from deportation to young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. The action is formally known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA.And while Cruz stated his intention to repeal the \"illegal\" action, he claimed that Rubio had appeared on the Spanish-language news channel Univision saying he would not rescind Obama's action.While it is true that Rubio did not call for DACA's immediate repeal, a review of his significant statements on the subject reveal that he has been consistent in his opposition to the action, even if a bit vague on a timeline for its elimination.In the April appearance on Univision that Cruz seems to have referenced, Rubio said in Spanish that DACA \"is going to have to end.\"During in an October appearance on Fusion, a Univision subsidiary, Rubio said in English that he was not calling for DACA to be revoked \"tomorrow or this week or right away.\"And in November, Rubio appeared to state definitively that, even in the absence of other immigration reform, he would support an end to DACA.One side note: Though a president needs to only issue a new executive action to \"rescind\" a previous executive action, Cruz's claim about his own intentions is misleading. Whether DACA is legal is a matter currently before the Supreme Court and a decision is expected by early summer. If the Supreme Court strikes it down, it will not be in place for the next president to \"rescind,\" and if the court upholds it, the action can no longer be considered \"illegal,\" as Cruz claims.We rate Cruz's claims about Rubio to be false.Reality Check: Cruz says Rubio supported in-state tuition for DREAMERs in FloridaBy Tom LoBianco, CNNCruz accused Rubio of supporting undocumented immigrants by pushing for in-state tuition for children who are undocumented immigrants, DREAMERs, when he was speaker of Florida's House of Representatives.\"Marco has a long record when it comes to amnesty. As speaker in the (Florida) statehouse, he supported in-state tuition for illegal immigrants,\" Cruz said.Rubio co-sponsored a Florida measure in 2004 that would have granted in-state tuition status for children who were undocumented immigrants if they met certain requirements, including a baseline grade point average.He defended the decision in an appearance on ABC's \"This Week\" last month.\"On the bill you talked about, it was a very narrowly drafted bill. You had to have a certain GPA, you had to live in the U.S. a long time, you had to graduate from a Florida high school,\" Rubio told ABC. \"It was very narrowly tailored to high-performing students who found themselves in a situation where they were brought here by their parents when they were 5, didn't even speak another language except English and therefore couldn't attend college because they were being charged like they were from out of state. They still had to pay for college but they paid for what people paid when they lived in Florida.\"But Rubio did not become speaker until 2006, well after he co-sponsored the in-state tuition measure.Verdict: Mostly true.Reality Check: Rubio says Cruz couldn't understand his Univision interview because he doesn't speak SpanishBy Theodore Schleifer, CNNRubio quickly fired back at Cruz, saying he couldn't have understood his Univision interview because he doesn't speak Spanish.\"I don't know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn't speak Spanish,\" Rubio said.In a June 2012 appearance on Fox News, Cruz said, \"my Spanish is lousy.\" He has said elsewhere that he grew up speaking \"Spanglish.\"While Cruz's Spanish may be far from perfect, he does speak the language. It's not something he touts often, but occasionally on the campaign trail he will speak in Spanish.Verdict: False.Donald Trump & Marco RubioReality Check: Trump and Rubio on killing Osama bin LadenBy Kate Grise, CNNDuring a bitter exchange between Trump and Rubio, the two candidates argued over which former president missed the opportunity to kill terrorist leader and 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden and whether or not the attacks on 9/11 could have been prevented.\"The World Trade Center came down because Bill Clinton didn't kill Osama bin Laden when he had the chance to kill him,\" Rubio said.\"And George Bush, by the way, George Bush had the chance, also, and he didn't listen to the advice of his CIA,\" Trump challenged.Clinton did have an opportunity to kill bin Laden with an airstrike in 1998, but didn't. He said so while speaking to a group of businessmen in Australia during a paid speech on September 10, 2001, the day before the 9/11 attacks. He said that he decided against the strike because he was concerned about civilian casualties.George W. Bush's administration has been widely criticized for not pursuing bin Laden more aggressively. A 2009 Senate Foreign Relations Committee report found that bin Laden was \"within our grasp at Tora Bora\" in late 2001 during Bush's administration.That report found that Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others in the administration rejected requests to launch assaults or provide U.S. troops to block possible mountain pathways used by bin Laden even though the commander's \"world had shrunk to a complex of caves and tunnels carved into a mountainous section of Eastern Afghanistan known as Tora Bora.\"According to the report, Rumsfeld said that he was concerned that sending U.S. troops into Afghanistan would create an anti-American backlash that could fuel a widespread insurgency.By the time 2007 rolled around, there was new intelligence that suggested bin Laden was planning to venture from his hideout in Pakistan to a meeting of al Qaeda and Taliban commanders and soldiers in Afghanistan. The Bush administration did plan a large airstrike mission, but later decided to scale back the attack to a smaller raid amid doubts that bin Laden would be at the meeting. At the end of the day, bin Laden did not show up to the meeting, according to the New York Times.Could Bush have done more to protect the country from the 9/11 attacks, as Trump implied? Bush received a memo one month before the attacks that said the FBI had detected \"patterns of suspicious activity in this country consistent with preparations for hijackings.\" It did not warn of the 9/11 attacks specifically or the use of airplanes as weapons -- just the possibility of hijackings, according to the Bush administration.Both Clinton and Bush were presented with a possible target, and both seem to have assessed the risk to civilians, U.S. servicemembers and others while also considering the quality of the intelligence they were being given. It should be noted that the U.S. military did not widely use drones before 2001, so airstrikes were less precise.Had either president successfully carried out a plan to kill bin Laden, it is not clear that his death would have stopped the attacks on 9/11. The 9/11 Commission's report found that of the 26 al Qaeda terrorist conspirators, the first of them began working on getting into the country in April 1999 -- two years and five months before the attacks. The hijackers who acted as pilots began to arrive in January 2000 and some of the other operatives arrived between April and June 2001. The last of the terrorists had arrived in the United States by August 2001.Ultimately, bin Laden was killed in a 2011 raid in Pakistan authorized by President Barack Obama.So, did both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have the chance to kill bin Laden? The short answer is yes, it's true. Did the World Trade Center come down because they failed to do so? It's complicated and we may never know the answer because we do not know when the plan to attack the World Trade Center was hatched. Given the intelligence that Bush had at the time, it is hard to say what he could have done to prevent the terror attacks on 9/11.Ben CarsonReality Check: Did Carson really quote Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin?By Amy Gallagher, CNNIn his closing statement, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson opened with a quote: \"Joseph Stalin said if you want to bring America down, you have to undermine three things -- our spiritual life, our patriotism and our morality.\" Carson went on to say, \"We, the people, can stop that decline.\" It's a popular quote, found on tea party sites such as \"Freedom Outpost,\" among others. And this was not the first time Carson has used the quote; the Iowa State Daily reported on January 24 that Carson \"referred to\" the quote, which they reproduced in full:\"America is like a healthy body and its resistance is threefold: Its patriotism, its morality and its spiritual life. If we can undermine these three areas, America will collapse from within.\" This is, indeed, a quote often attributed to the Soviet dictator. However, there does not seem to be much evidence for that attribution.In an investigation into the authenticity of the quote, mythbusting site Snopes.com found that \"searching collections of Stalin's speeches, writings, interviews and other statements (such as the Joseph Stalin Internet Archive and the University of Pennsylvania's online library of Stalin documents) fails to turn up any reference to this quotation.\" This investigation was updated on February 1. Snopes further found that the quotation did not occur in print until 1983, when Cathy Bicksler of Pine Haven, Connecticut, wrote a letter to the editor of the Lawrence Journal-World attributing the quote to Stalin. Since Stalin died in 1953 and left behind a large library of published works (including some poetry reported not to be all that bad), Snopes was quick to point out that one would expect the quote to appear somewhere in print -- either in writings about Stalin or in his own letters, books or records of newspapers during his lifetime. The fact that it first surfaced in an obscure way long after his death suggests that it is, in fact, a misattribution or a fabrication.Millard Fillmore's Bathtub, a blog dedicated to debunking false history, also found the quote to be \"bogus\" in part for another reason cited by Snopes: Stalin was the least likely person to ever say anything positive about the United States. \"Stalin,\" said Ed Darrell, the blog's author and a former employee of the federal government who worked on the library database with the largest collection of U.S. history textbooks, \"was of a school that claimed capitalism was diseased, and America was infested with a soon-to-be terminal case.\" We rate the attribution of this quotation to Stalin false.John KasichReality Check: Kasich on his Ohio economic recordBy Sandee LaMotte, CNNOhio Gov. John Kasich repeated his claim of turning around the Ohio economy. \"What I would tell you is we've gone from an $8 billion hole to a $2 billion surplus, and we've cut taxes by more than any governor in America by $5 billion. We have grown the number of jobs by 400,000 private sector jobs since I've been governor. Our credit is strong, our pensions are strong, and frankly, we leave no one behind.\" Kasich's claim to have turned Ohio's economy around is based on a projection by his own budget officials when he took office of a $7.7 billion shortfall if the economy continued on the same path. However, the budget he submitted in March 2011 projected a rosier future. The recovery of the national economy, which was also benefiting Ohio, was projected to pump about $2 billion into state revenue over the next two years. That makes the real shortfall about $6 billion, give or take a few million. However, Kasich has continued to use the original numbers for his claims as he runs for office.Despite those differences, it is true that Ohio currently has a $2 billion rainy day fund.So the reality is that Kasich, and an improving national economy, helped reduce Ohio's shortfall from approximately $6 billion to a $2 billion surplus.Kasich goes on to say he has grown private sectors jobs by 400,000, and recent Bureau of Labor Statistics data bears that out. However, critics point out that number is still well below the national average, and that 21 states have higher private sector job growth. In addition, critics say, Kasich isn't counting cuts in public-sector employment in Ohio, such as teachers and municipal, county and township employees, which they say have shrunk by more than 2% while Kasich's been in office.Kasich also claims to have cut more taxes than any other governor. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Ohio does rank among the top five states with highest personal income tax budget cuts. However, CBPP also points out that states which relied on this as an economic prescription have actually seen \"their share of national employment decline since enacting the cuts.\"Verdict: Mostly true.", "article_highlights": "The Republican candidates for president gathered Saturday in Greenville, South Carolina, for their final debate before the Palmetto State's primary next weekThe team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated", "article_author": "CNN's Reality Check Team"}

If you're sitting around pondering a Jeb Bush candidacy, it's the first obvious question that you have to be able to answer,\" said GOP strategist Steve Schmidt, who helped John McCain craft his message on Iraq during the 2008 election. \"What his answer shows is the difficulty in moving beyond the Bush foreign policy in order to be able to attack the Obama-Clinton foreign policy, and to offer a vision for moving the country on to a firmer security footing.\"The issue has become a significant distraction for Bush as he tours the nation ahead of a potential White House bid.One Wednesday night, Bush found himself defending his brother's policies after a college student confronted him in Nevada. \"Your brother created ISIS,\" she told him during an accusatory exchange on the current situation in the Middle East.Bush's Republican rivals pounced at the opening.'Really important question'\"I think it's a really important question, and I don't think it's just hypothetical,\" Kentucky Sen.

John Kasich took a similar stance in an interview with an Ohio newspaper.Two GOP bundlers who couldn't speak with attribution because they are raising money for Bush said it was unnerving to see their candidate so prone to gaffes. Still, they shrugged it off as part of the campaign process.READ: Jeb: George W. Bush is a top foreign policy adviserWhile it has been a tough week for Bush, the return of the Iraq debate is also a reminder that the war perhaps looms even larger for Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. Of all the candidates contemplating a presidential run, she is the only one in the field who has cast a vote to authorize military action in Iraq. Some Democratic voters still have not forgiven her for the vote -- cast when she served as a senator from New York -- which was a significant factor in her loss to Barack Obama during the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries.\"I thought I had acted in good faith and made the best decision I could with the information I had,\" Clinton, a former secretary of state, wrote in her book \"Hard Choices.\" \"And I wasn't alone in getting it wrong. But I still got it wrong.\"Still, Clinton has not addressed her vote on Iraq since announcing her presidential bid, whereas Bush spent much of this week in the awkward position of having to clarify his views.'Different decisions'He went a step further at a political event in Nevada on Wednesday, saying, \"given the power of looking back and having that, of course anybody would have made different decisions. There's no denying that.\" He did not go so far as to say the war was a mistake, arguing that hypothetical questions about what he would have done are a disservice to the soldiers that fought and died in the conflict.With months to go before GOP voters cast their first ballots in the early nominating contests, it's not clear that any of Bush's early stumbles will leave lasting damage. \"If you're going to make (mistakes) -- make them nine months out,\" said Tom Rath, a New Hampshire political operative who isn't aligned with a candidate. \"I don't know that his position in the field has been impacted by this, but he was playing defense.\"But Craig Robinson, a GOP activist who founded The Iowa Republican, said the flap over Bush's Iraq comments could further weaken his standing among GOP voters in the Hawkeye State -- not only because they raised questions about his polish as a candidate, but because they also created confusion about how his foreign policy approach would differ from his brother's. Bush's original comment \"resurrected the debate on Iraq, which is a losing argument,\" Robinson said. \"His refusal now to answer any similar questions after he claims to have misheard the original questions is even worse,\" Robinson said. \"Nobody wants to go back and litigate war in Iraq, even now as the GOP is very hawkish when it comes to foreign policy. The problem with Jeb's answer, and now non-answer, is that we are left to wonder what his foreign policy would be if elected president.\"While the war in Iraq was unpopular with the American public -- 75% said it was not \"worth the loss of American lives and other costs,\" in a June 2014 CBS News/New York Times poll -- the conversation surrounding that corner of the globe has moved beyond the invasion in recent years. At Bush's political event in Nevada Wednesday, the first question was not about the war that was launched more than a decade ago, but rather the rise of the Islamic State militant group.READ: Jeb Bush tries to move past Iraq questions\"What happened in 2003 is not a subject of a policy debate that affects what the U.S. is doing in Iraq today and what the U.S. will be doing in Iraq tomorrow,\" said Anthony Cordesman, an expert on security and Middle East policy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \"The world is a very different place.\"The discussion surrounding Iraq has evolved to include the fight against ISIS and broader sectarian, political and economic instability, he said.\"If Bush had been a little more articulate, people would've picked up on the fact that he was making that point,\" Cordesman said. But \"if he can't rise above this issue, he hasn't got a prayer anyway.\"The confrontation with the college student in Nevada about ISIS resulted in a new riff on him defending hisbrother's foreign policy.\"When we left Iraq, security had been arranged, Al Qaeda had been taken out. There was a fragile system that could have been brought up to eliminate the sectarian violence,\" he said, arguing that the rise of ISIS was President Obama's fault, not his brothers.9 photos: Political families in historyRand and Ron Paul are far from the first father and son to each mount a presidential campaign \u2014 in fact, they're not even the only family connection in the 2016 field.

Jeb Bush said, \"As it relates to Iran, we need to confront ambitions across the board, reimpose sanctions. They already violated sanctions after the agreement was signed by testing medium-range missiles.\"The agreement Bush was referring to was the deal reached last year between Iran, the United States and five other countries that seeks to roll back Iran's ability to obtain a nuclear weapon.JUST WATCHEDBush: Trump's ban makes it impossible to take out ISIS ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBush: Trump's ban makes it impossible to take out ISIS01:23Since the signing of that agreement, Iran has indeed tested missile technology. The test violated sanctions not covered by the new deal but rather in contravention of existing U.N. Security Council resolutions.Last month, a panel at the United Nations said Iran violated existing resolutions when it tested a ballistic missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead in October.But under the terms of the agreement reached in Vienna last year over Iran's nuclear program, the missile tests, while violating existing resolutions, are actually not a violation of the new agreement because that accord is focused on restricting Iran's path to a nuclear weapon.In fact, the October ballistic missile test violation would not contravene the nuclear agreement brokered with Iran once it goes into effect, which the Obama administration believes will happen soon. Under the new nuclear deal, Iran will be able to conduct ballistic missile tests -- a concession to Iran included in the deal -- meaning Iran could have simply waited until after implementation of the deal to do the test.Verdict: True -- Iran violated the sanctions, but not the nuclear weapons agreementMarco RubioReality Check: Rubio on Cruz's opposition to ethanolBy Theodore Schleifer, CNNSen. Marco Rubio of Florida claimed that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas flipped on his support for ethanol, just one attack in a rapid-fire succession of them, but also the one that could matter the most in Iowa, which is a leading corn producer.Cruz has always opposed the Renewable Fuel Standard, the fuel mandate supported by the state's ethanol interests, calling it an example of corporate welfare pushed by \"lobbyists and Democrats.\" It's an issue that Cruz has taken flak over all across Iowa, with voters frequently questioning him at town halls and retail stops concerned about his view.JUST WATCHEDRubio to Cruz: We all saw you flip your voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRubio to Cruz: We all saw you flip your vote 02:00Cruz admits that he did co-sponsor a 2013 bill that would've ended the RFS immediately. But his current position, as outlined in a 2014 comprehensive energy bill he introduced in the Senate, is to phase it out over five years, with his policy as of now to end the RFS by 2022.The ethanol lobby sending negative mailers about Cruz's record says that he did flip, but Cruz denies that, pointing to his bill instead of the one he co-sponsored. Cruz's personal preference, however, has always been for a five-year phase-out.Verdict: FalseReality Check: Rubio says Obamacare is a certified job killerBy Tami Luhby and Kate Grise, CNNRubio said that Obamacare is \"a certified job killer.\"In fact, Obamacare is not a job killer, according to the 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September 2015.The report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. In fact, that study showed that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.An ADP Research Institute study had similar findings.One reason may be that the economy has been improving. Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.As to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. The number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.Verdict: FalseMarco Rubio and Chris ChristieReality Check: Rubio claims Christie supported Sonia SotomayorBy Marshall Cohen, CNNSen. Marco Rubio took a swipe at Chris Christie when he said the New Jersey governor backed President Barack Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in 2009. Christie hastily denied the accusation.But looking back at the record, Christie did in fact support Sotomayor's nomination. It was July 2009, and Christie locked in a tight race for governor of New Jersey, a Democratic-leaning state. Perhaps in an attempt to appeal to moderate voters, Christie said \"elections have consequences\" and threw his support behind Obama's nominee. \"While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice, President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability, competence and ability,\" Christie said at the time. \"I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination.\"Verdict: Rubio's claim is true, and Christie's is falseReality Check: Rubio accuses Christie of donating to Planned ParenthoodBy Marshall Cohen, CNNJUST WATCHEDSen. Rubio and Gov. Christie's heated exchange ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSen. Rubio and Gov. Christie's heated exchange01:17Rubio also accused Christie of donating to Planned Parenthood, a highly contentious allegation, especially considering the effort among conservatives to strip the organization of its federal funds.After the allegations first surfaced, The (Newark) Star-Ledger unearthed a 1994 article where Christie, who was running at the time for a position in county government, said, \"I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency, to find private donations.\"But in the past week, Christie insisted that he was misquoted in the old article: \"This is a quote from 21 years ago. I'm convinced it was a misquote,\" Christie told The Washington Post. \" Understand what was going on. In 1994-95, I was fighting against county funding of Planned Parenthood even though I was pro-choice.\"So it's true that Christie once said he donated to Planned Parenthood, and Rubio and his allies are holding that article up as proof. But Christie claims the quote was inaccurate. So given the \"he said, he said\" situation, it's difficult to know for sure where the truth lies.Verdict: It's complicatedDonald TrumpReality Check: Trump says Paris has the \"strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world\"By Ryan Browne, CNNDonald Trump said the terrorist attacks in Paris last year happened despite the city having \"the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world.\"However, in France, private gun ownership, while heavily regulated, is permitted.According to French law, to get any category one or four weapons, like a Glock pistol, you need to be 21, to have joined a shooting range for the last six months, provided a blank criminal record and a certificate of physical and mental health not older than two weeks. Then, the local police precinct starts a \"morality investigation\" in your neighborhood, according to French journalist Phillipe Coste.While French laws are restrictive, the gun laws in the UK are even more so. After a series of mass shootings in the 1980s and 1990s, the UK passed a law effectively banning the private ownership of all handguns.According to the UK government's Home Office 2015 \"Guide on Firearms Licensing Law,\" the British Firearms Act of 1968 and its 1997 modification \"has meant the prohibition of handguns.\"Verdict: FalseTrump-Cruz 'bromance is overReality Check: Trump on law professor about CruzBy Kevin Liptak, CNNIn defending his questioning of Sen. Ted Cruz's eligibility for the presidency, Donald Trump cited Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe, who Trump claimed is raising \"a serious question to whether or not Ted can do this.\"Although Tribe has weighed in on Cruz's eligibility, he has not outright questioned whether Cruz -- who was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father -- would be considered a \"natural born citizen,\" the definition of which Tribe says is \"completely unsettled.\"JUST WATCHEDTrump to Cruz: You're a liability as a candidateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump to Cruz: You're a liability as a candidate 02:07What Tribe has questioned is whether Cruz's own originalist judicial theories -- expressed when the senator was a student in his Harvard Law class, and again on the campaign trail when speaking about potential judicial nominations -- would render himself eligible for the White House.\"Ironically, the kind of justices he says he wants are the ones that say he's not eligible to run for president,\" Tribe argued on CNN this week. \"This is important because the way this guy plays fast and loose with the Constitution, he's a fair-weather originalist.\"In a Boston Globe editorial, Tribe argued that almost any judge would avoid weighing in on Cruz's eligibility.\"No real court is likely to keep Cruz off the ballot, much less remove him from the White House if he were to win -- Bush v. Gore isn't likely to get a return engagement over this issue,\" he wrote.But soon after the debate concluded, Tribe went further, telling CNN's Anderson Cooper that the issue is a \"serious cloud\" over Cruz and saying he can see a challenge going to the Supreme Court.\"If some secretary of state refuses to put his name on the ballot if he's the nominee, there's no way out of it other than to have Cruz or the Republican National Committee sue the secretary of state. And that issue would then have to go all the way to the Supreme Court,\" Tribe said. \"But the fact is, you know, it's a serious cloud. It has to be taken seriously. It's not just a matter of coming up with great talking points or winning some debate. I think he does a disservice to the Constitution and the country when he thinks he can slide his way, slip slide his way around this serious constitutional issue,\" Tribe said.Verdict: True (Editor's note: We changed the verdict from false because Tribe's comments after the debate suggested a legal fight was much more likely.)Ted CruzReality Check: Cruz on the U.S. sending $100 billion to IranBy Eve Bower and Sonam Vashi, CNNSen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, \"President Obama is preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khomeini. I will tell you, it was heart-breaking ...\"We previously fact-checked this when Donald Trump made a similar claim in the December 15 debate. Here's what we found: In 2011 and 2012, the United States and Europe imposed sanctions on Iran that included freezing some Iranian assets overseas. With the announcement of a deal in 2015, those same assets stand to be released, creating a pool of money that will be newly available to the Iranian government. The total amount of those assets is not known, but as a deal with Iran seemed imminent, some estimated that the number was as high as $150 billion.In late July, at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the deal, House Speaker John Boehner, just as Cruz said, claimed that \"more than $100 billion\" in unfrozen assets would be available to Iran.Both the Treasury Department and the White House have disputed these estimates.JUST WATCHEDTed Cruz deflects NYT 'hit piece'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTed Cruz deflects NYT 'hit piece' 01:20In Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew's July testimony to the Senate, he estimated that, after sanctions relief, Iran will only be able to access \"about $50 billion\" in unfrozen assets. He noted that another large portion -- about $20 billion -- was tied up in projects with China, and \"tens of billions\" comprise nonperforming loans to Iranian energy and banking interests.The money already belongs to Iran but has been frozen, so the United States is not sending this money from its coffers to the Iranian government. Additionally, none of the parties with access to the assets have substantiated an estimate close to the figure that Cruz suggested.Verdict: FalseReality Check: Cruz on percentage of Americans workingBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoneyAsked whether America's economy is as strong as President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address, Sen. Ted Cruz said, \"We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.\"Last month, 59.5% of Americans age 16 and older were employed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's higher than it was in 1977, when it ranged from 57% to 58.7%.The share of Americans employed during Obama's terms has ranged from as low as 58.2% in mid-2011 to as high as 60.6% when Obama took office in January 2009.Since 1977, the highest share of Americans were employed in April 2000, when 64.7% had a job.However, the overall percentage of adults who are working isn't the best measure, since the number of retirees is growing as the nation ages. So let's look at the share of prime working age adults (age 25 to 54) who are employed. Some 77.4% of these Americans were employed in December, compared to between 71% and 72.8% in 1977.By no measure is the share of Americans employed at its lowest point since 1977.Verdict: FalseOpinion: Who won the Trump-Cruz smackdown?Reality Check: Cruz on Dianne Feinstein taking away all gunsBy Lisa Rose, CNNDuring a discussion of proposed reforms to gun laws in the wake of recent mass shootings, Cruz claimed, \"California senator, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America give me your guns, I'm rounding them up, she would.\"Feinstein did say something to that effect -- 21 years ago. And she was referring specifically to assault rifles, not all firearms.Cruz exhumed the comment from a 1995 episode of \"60 Minutes,\" during which Feinstein discussed the limitations of the assault weapons ban. She talked about loopholes in the law that allowed dealers to sell assault rifles weapons at gun shows.\"If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, 'Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in,' I would have done it,\" Feinstein said. \"I could not do that. The votes weren't here.\"Because Feinstein's comments were only about assault weapons and made 21 years ago, not as part of Obama's current initiative, we rate his claim true, but misleading.Reality Check: Cruz on Manhattan's conservativesBy Kevin Liptak, CNNCruz, explaining his attack on Donald Trump's \"New York values,\" asserted there are \"not a lot of conservatives coming out of Manhattan.\"JUST WATCHEDCruz, Trump debate 'New York values'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCruz, Trump debate 'New York values' 01:37There's no doubt New York City's third-most-populous borough is known more for liberal urbanites than as a bastion of conservatism. But the island is not without its Republicans.Voter registration records indicate there are 83,970 active Republicans on the rolls in Manhattan -- only about 10% of the total number registered, but not an insignificant portion.Some of those Republicans carry outsized influence on the national political stage. The latest federal campaign finance filings show Manhattan donors contributed $2.9 million to Republican presidential candidates, the second-highest concentration of donations in the country behind Houston.Cruz himself has taken in $135,588 from Manhattan's ZIP codes this cycle, behind his rivals Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, but still more than many other Republicans in the race. While those numbers are far behind the campaign cash taken in by Democrats in Manhattan, the borough clearly remains a magnet for politicians of all stripes looking to raise funds.The federal filings also don't account for contributions to outside groups like super PACs, which raise enormous amounts of money from wealthy Manhattan donors. One of the most prolific conservative political donors, David Koch, is a resident of Park Avenue.Cruz's claim that \"not a lot of conservatives\" come out of Manhattan is, based on pure voter registration numbers, true. But the influence of the Republicans that do reside there extends well beyond the East and Hudson rivers.Verdict: Mostly trueCarly FiorinaReality Check: Fiorina on vetting visa applicants' social media accountsBy Kate Grise, CNNDuring the Fox Business Network undercard debate, Carly Fiorina claimed that \"this (Obama) administration has told us they don't even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out who's pledging allegiance to jihadists. We can do better than this, citizens. We need to take our country back.\"On December 16, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that the department has, in fact, been examining social media when reviewing visa applications since early 2015. \"Under my leadership as secretary, we, in fact, began to consult social media in connection with conferring various immigration benefits and we will be doing more of this,\" he added. \"Any reports or partial reports to the contrary are simply false.\"JUST WATCHEDFiorina slams Trump, ClintonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFiorina slams Trump, Clinton 01:16Johnson did acknowledge that there were some restrictions on looking at an applicant's social media account before 2015, but said that there was no current policy prohibiting the check of an applicant's social media.\"We had policies in place regarding consulting social media, which in my judgment, particularly in this current environment, were too restrictive,\" Johnson said.Many have criticized immigration officials for not checking the social media accounts of Tashfeen Malik, one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, after there were reports that she advocated jihad in messages on social media. Her comments were made under a pseudonym and with strict privacy settings that did not allow people outside a small group of friends to see them, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN.FBI Director James Comey said that neither Malik or her husband and fellow shooter posted publicly on social media about supporting jihad.However, they did show \"signs in their communication of their joint commitment to jihad and to martyrdom\" in private messages, according to Comey. The comments were private communications, both by phone and social media, and the U.S. government was not monitoring them because they had no reason to. The couple were not on any terrorist watch lists, and Malik made her comments under a fake name behind many privacy settings that would have required a warrant to access them. Even if immigration officials had looked at Malik's social media accounts, they would not have had access to her private communications.JUST WATCHEDFiorina: We can't outsource leadership in Middle EastReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFiorina: We can't outsource leadership in Middle East 01:13A U.S. official told CNN that the United States only recently began routinely reviewing the social media activity of visa applications from certain countries. The exact date that these types of reviews began is not clear, but it was after Malik's application was considered, the source said.While the policy changed only a year ago, Fiorina's claim that immigration officials don't bother looking at visa applicant's social media has been untrue for more a year.Verdict: FalseReality Check: Fiorina on record numbers of men out of workBy Tami Luhby and Sonam Vashi, CNN\"We have record numbers of men out of work, we have record numbers of women living in poverty, we have young people who no longer believe that that the American Dream applies to them,\" Fiorina said.Related: Why have so many men stopped working?There were 42.1 million men who were not working in December, just below the record 42.9 million set in October 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This includes men who were not in the labor force, as well as those who are unemployed. (To be included in the labor force, you have to be working or actively looking for a job.)While Fiorina's comment is true, it is misleading because the vast majority of men who are not in the labor force are not looking for work. They include students, retirees and those who've just given up trying to find a job.That said, there is an employment crisis among working-age men these days. The labor force participation rate -- which includes those who are working or have looked for a job in the past four weeks -- is near record lows. The share of men ages 25 to 54 in the labor force now hovers near a record low of 88%. It stood at nearly 97% in 1965.Verdict: True, but misleadingReality Check: Fiorina on Geneva ConventionsBy Jamie Crawford and Ryan Browne, CNN Regarding Iran's brief detention of U.S. Navy sailors, Fiorina said, \"The President wouldn't even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors -- hostage. He didn't mention the fact that they violated the Geneva Conventions.\"The Geneva Conventions are a series of treaties and rules that apply in times of armed conflict and also seek to protect people who are not or are no longer taking part in hostilities.In a briefing with reporters on Thursday, State Department spokesman John Kirby said, \"The Geneva Conventions apply for wartime; we're not at war with Iran. So, it's a moot question.\"Legal experts with whom CNN spoke tend to agree with that assertion. \"We don't have a state of declared war or actual armed conflict between the U.S. and Iran, therefore the application of the Geneva Conventions does not come into play,\" Allen Weiner, the director of Stanford's Program in International and Comparative Law, told CNN. \"Both sides have said it was an inadvertent crossing into territorial waters, where Iran is entitled to exercise criminal jurisdiction,\" Weiner added.Steven Vladeck, a professor at American University School of Law in Washington and a CNN contributor, told CNN that \"Common Article 2 of Geneva is clear on this,\" and only applies in a state of war or armed conflict.\"There is a whole lot of daylight between animosity and armed conflict,\" Vladeck said, adding other legal mechanisms applying to international human rights law or governing the law of the sea, but the absence of direct armed conflict between the two countries negates the application of the Geneva Conventions in this case.But legal experts said there are relevant legal provisions that Iran could be in violation of based on what occurred.Some experts CNN spoke to did indicate that the Iranian actions may have violated customary maritime law. In a situation where a ship enters territory waters due to a technical problem or damage, a country \"would have the right to verify the problem\" but not use force to detain the sailors, according to Craig Allen, a professor of marine and environmental affairs at the University of Washington. Verdict: FalseRick SantorumReality Check: Santorum on Americans without college degreesBy Lisa Rose, CNNRick Santorum said that President Barack Obama's policies have hurt the manufacturing sector, creating dwindling employment opportunities for the \"74% of Americans who don't have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65.\"The former senator, a Penn State alum who once called the President a snob for promoting higher education, needs to check his numbers again.JUST WATCHEDRick Santorum: Go Google meReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRick Santorum: Go Google me 01:00According to 2014 census data, the most recent stats available, 67% of Americans between 25 and 64 have not graduated from college. The total number of people in that age bracket is 164.8 million, and 55.2 million of them have not attained a bachelor's degree or higher.Santorum made a similar statement in May on \"Face the Nation,\" although he blamed both parties for failing to address economic inequality among the \"70% of Americans who don't have a college degree.\" Politifact checked his claim and rated it true, crunching Census numbers to conclude that 68% of Americans 25 and older don't have degrees, good enough for a green light from the website.Santorum wasn't a math major at Penn State so he can be forgiven for the miscalculation, but he should have stuck with his original estimate.

I don't begrudge him that. It was a decision made based on a campaign promise,\" he told reporters in New Hampshire. \"It wasn't based on conditions in Iraq at the time and I think we're paying a price for it.\"Critics at the time warned that extremist elements would grow more powerful without a U.S. presence, and now Republican presidential contenders are pointing to the rise of ISIS as proof that the United States should have pushed harder to stay in Iraq.In his remarks at the business roundtable -- an event organized by New Hampshire activist Renee Plummer -- Bush defended his brother's leadership during the Iraq war.\"ISIS didn't exist when my brother was President. Al Qaeda in Iraq was wiped out when my brother was President,\" he said. \"There were mistakes made in Iraq, for sure, but the surge created a fragile but stable Iraq that the President could've built on and it would've not allowed ISIS.\"He called for a plan to \"take out ISIS\" with help from other countries, saying there is currently \"no strategic imperative\" to restore stability in Iraq. Asked later by reporters what that strategy should be and whether it should include combat troops in the area, Bush said he would rely on advice from military advisers.\"We have ground troops in Iraq. I would take the best advice that you could get from the military. Make the decisions based on conditions on the ground, not for some political purpose,\" he said. \"Whether we need more than 3,000 -- which is what we have now -- I would base that on what the military advisers say.\"JUST WATCHEDPanel: Bush should have been prepared for Iraq questionReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHPanel: Bush should have been prepared for Iraq question 04:32Bush struggled to answer questions last week about whether he would have gone into Iraq knowing what's known now about faulty intelligence that initially spurred military action. After multiple days of unclear answers, he ultimately said he would not have invaded in hindsight.RELATED: Can Jeb Bush escape his brother's legacy on Iraq?His difficulty in answering the question -- one that pits his loyalty to his brother against political calculation -- created a narrative that drew criticism from other White House hopefuls and sparked questions of whether Bush was ready for prime time.At the roundtable in Wednesday, however, Bush was met with encouragement from voters. When one man called Bush's family an \"asset,\" the room broke out into applause. As he's done at every event, Bush maintained that he loved his family, and he sought to assure the audience that he's gotten through last week's storm. \"It got bumpy, but all is well now,\" he said. \"The ship is stable.\"21 photos: Jeb Bush's lifeFormer Florida Gov.

Bush's policies, particularly the war in Iraq, are still unpopular with large swaths of Americans.In a September 2013 CNN/ ORC poll, 62% of Americans said sending troops to Iraq was a mistake. But the conversation about Iraq has changed in recent years as the U.S. has re-engaged there to help the government deal with the rise of ISIS, the terror network that has its base in portions of Iraq and Syria. 23 photos: Photos: George W.

Disapproval of Obama's management of the ISIS crisis has climbed from 49% in late September to 57% now, potentially providing an opening for Republicans to push for tougher foreign policy.And Bush will slam Obama's foreign policy as \"inconsistent and indecisive,\" pointing out that Obama's foreign policy has made the U.S. less influential despite Obama's promise to engage leaders around the world, what Bush will dub \"the great irony\" of Obama's presidency, according to excerpts.But Bush is nevertheless likely to find himself pulled into a debate over conflicts initiated by George W. Bush that still vex U.S. policymakers and remain an open wound in American politics.DemocratsDemocrats insist they won't let Bush get away with his pledge to not re-litigate old wars.\"If you thought George Bush's foreign policy made the world less safe, then you're going to really hate Jeb Bush's approach,\" said Mo Elleithee, communications director of the Democratic National Committee. \"Even with the benefit of hindsight, he's one of the few people left who still stands by the decision to rush into a war in Iraq based on false information, even when it took resources away from the hunt for al Qaeda in Afghanistan. And he's made it pretty clear that if he had his way, we'd still be in Iraq and staying there indefinitely. \"Democrats believe George W.

Neither war produced a clear-cut U.S. victory and both nations still face intractable political, military and sectarian challenges, including the rise of ISIS and the resilience of the Taliban, which will be among the most pressing foreign challenges for the next president.The politics of the Iraq war, meanwhile, remain toxic, and disputes over the origins of the conflict-- which have never been resolved -- cloud the debate over how to rescue Iraq from its current plight. Even people who worked for his brother believe Jeb Bush needs to address Iraq soon.\"There is no question that Gov. Bush has to talk about Iraq at some point,\" said Peter Feaver, who was a leading official responsible for Iraq on George W. Bush's National Security Council and is now at Duke University. \"Those questions will be asked of him and he has to have an answer.\"Kori Schake, who also worked as a senior foreign policy aide in the Bush administration, agreed. \"I do think he is in a vulnerable position on Iraq because of his last name,\" she said, conceding that the public perception of the Bush legacy on foreign policy was a wider problem for his party, not just Jeb Bush.\"Conservatives, Republicans have to rebuild public confidence in what we say we are going to do,\" said Schake, now at the Hoover Institution. \"That is a high hurdle but it is an achievable hurdle.\" Bush can take several approaches. 66 photos: The ISIS terror threat66 photos: The ISIS terror threatSyrian pro-government forces gather at the site of a deadly triple bombing Sunday, January 31, in the Damascus suburb of Sayeda Zeynab.

Bush when Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein marched into Kuwait in 1989, evolved into a standoff and occasional air strikes under President Bill Clinton and erupted into a full-scale invasion under George W. Bush.And now under President Barack Obama a quarter of a century later, America's misadventure in the fractured Middle Eastern nation has transformed into a slog against the bloodthirsty Sunni radicals of ISIS.With no end in sight.A fight that won't end by 2016Senior administration officials have already admitted that the fight against ISIS will go beyond the current presidency -- in the process hinting at one of the great disappointments of the Obama era.In 20 months, the President who was elected perhaps more than anything else to end the Iraq war, will bequeath to his successor a new phase of that same intractable conflict.Despite declaring the war over -- and bringing home the last U.S. soldier in December 2011 -- Obama has been sucked back in. Just this weekend, an ISIS surge into the key Iraqi city of Ramadi and a U.S. Special Operations raid into Syria to kill one of the group's top leaders have shown that American involvement has not ended, and that the engagement is proceeding without any clear sign of victory.Iraq's enduring power to confound American presidents -- and to reverberate in successive presidential campaigns -- is a reminder that when America goes to war abroad, anything but a swift, clear-cut victory unleashes an unpredictable cascade of political consequences at home. 12 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentials12 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 1 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 2 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 3 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 4 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 5 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 6 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 7 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 8 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 9 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 10 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 11 of 1212 photos: 2016ers' foreign policy credentialsHide Caption 12 of 12\"Failed wars always hurt the president fighting them, but also continue to impact the party of the presidency for decades after they are gone,\" said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history at Princeton University.Iraq has become a political issue akin to Vietnam, as politicians seize on the aftermath of an inconclusive war to eviscerate their rivals' handling of foreign policy.Democrats make a case that the 2003 invasion invalidated an entire school of Republican political thought -- neoconservatism -- and say the war proves the GOP cannot be trusted with U.S. national security.Republicans meanwhile insist the war was all but won in 2009 by Bush's belated troop surge and blame Obama for being more concerned with honoring a political promise to end the war than the reality of the deeply unstable nation he left behind.Still, Mark Atwood Lawrence, professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin, argues that political fallout from the Iraq war could prove to be less radioactive than that of Vietnam, which took decades to play itself out.One reason for that is the bipartisan consensus now forming that the war was a mistake given that Hussein's weapons of mass destruction -- used as a justification for war -- did not exist.Politicians catch up with public consensusIt's perhaps a surprise that politicians took so long to catch up to this predominant view given that citizens made up their minds long ago.In a New York Times/CBS News poll last year, 75% of those asked said the Iraq war was not worth the loss of American lives. The findings are consistent with other opinion surveys.The GOP reluctance to criticize the decision to go to war stems in part from the candidates' desire not to alienate conservative primary voters thirsting for tough-talking foreign policy. And calling the war a mistake raises the treacherous question of whether the deaths of more than 4,000 U.S. troops were a waste.READ: Republican field pressed on IraqBut it still perplexed many political insiders that it took former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush a week of painfully groping for answers to come up with a satisfactory, and some believed obvious, response: that had he known then that U.S. intelligence on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction was flawed, he would not have gone to war in 2003.Jeb Bush was at least trapped between his own political fortunes and loyalty to his brother. But Republican candidate Marco Rubio, a Florida senator, had no such family ties to blame for his trouble putting to rest questions about his views on the topic. Rubio got into a heated dispute on Fox News Sunday after denying that he had flip-flopped by now concluding that the Iraq war was a mistake.Their apparent confusion has provided an opening for fellow Republican Rand Paul, a Kentucky senator and presidential candidate, to renew his argument for a foreign policy derided by critics as isolationist but in tune with the majority of voters who now view the Iraq war as a mistake.Paul pushes his foreign policy casePaul said at a GOP dinner in Iowa this past weekend that the notion that the Iraq war should never have been fought is \"a valid question, not just because we're talking about history, but we are talking about the Middle East, where history repeats itself.\"It isn't only Republicans who are vulnerable on the issue. Hillary Clinton needs no reminder of the capacity of Iraq to crush political dreams, after her 2002 Senate vote to authorize the Iraq war cost her primary support and paved Obama's way to the presidency.Clinton, conscious of the consequences of admitting her judgment on national security was flawed, never said during her 2008 White House bid that her Senate vote on Iraq was a mistake.But in last year's book \"Hard Choices,\" in which she provided a blueprint for how supporters could defend her record, she was much more clear.\"I got it wrong. Plain and simple,\" she wrote.Some U.S. foreign policy veterans are warning that the political debate in Washington is hampering hopes of meeting the challenge to U.S. security posed by ISIS and finally closing America's book on Iraq. Where once it was politically difficult to oppose the use of force in Iraq, now that position has become toxic.\"Now Iraq poses a threat -- it didn't 10 years ago,\" said James Rubin, an assistant secretary of state under Clinton, referring to ISIS and its efforts to export its ideology and terror tactics to the West.\"It's a shame that the politics, the pendulum of our political system, has swung so far to the other direction that our President and others are not prepared to take some modest steps to defeat a genuine threat, not the fake threat that was exaggerated 10 years ago,\" Rubin told CNN.JUST WATCHEDCan Jeb Bush recover from Iraq war stumble?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCan Jeb Bush recover from Iraq war stumble? 01:54Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Stephen Collinson, CNN"}

He drew an even starker contrast with the rest of the field on the war, declaring in a Wednesday interview on CNN that he's always felt invading Iraq was a bad idea.\"I thought the war, even at the time, was a mistake, [even] given the intelligence,\" he told CNN's Wolf Blitzer.Paul struck his familiar libertarian tone in explaining his rationale, arguing that toppling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein left both the region and the U.S. worse off in the long run. He said that generally, taking out secular dictators is a bad idea because every time it's happened, \"things have been worse and America has been less safe.\"But Paul insisted he's not an isolationist -- a charge opponents have thrown at him -- and did express support for military action against ISIS, though he called for \"Arab boots on the ground\" to defeat the terrorist group, rather than American troops.Other Republicans who are squaring off with Bush in the party's 2016 presidential primary hit him and offered their own answers to the question. \"I don't think you can honestly say that if we knew then that there was no (weapons of mass destruction), that the country should have gone to war,\" Christie said in an interview on CNN's \"The Lead\" with Jake Tapper.

But the poll numbers have,\" Cruz said.He said following Trump's logic to the furthest possible extent, Trump's own qualifications could be questioned due to the businessman's Scottish-born mother.As Cruz rebutted Trump for raising the issue -- effectively winning the moment -- Trump essentially held his hands up and said he's not the one who's concerned.\"I'm beating you,\" Trump said. \"I think I'm going to win fair and square.\" And he succeeded in keeping the question alive -- a loss, in and of itself, for Cruz. Trump asked: \"If you become the nominee, who the hell knows if you can even serve in office?\" That's the point Harvard law professor Laurence Tribe, the legal source Trump has cited and Cruz has dismissed as liberal, made on CNN after the debate. \"If he did put it to bed, he's certainly sleeping alone,\" he said. Opinion: Who won Trump-Cruz smackdown?New York, New YorkTrump seemed genuinely taken aback by Cruz's insult of his \"New York values.\"Cruz explained that jab, saying: \"Everyone understands that the values in New York City are socially liberal, are pro-abortion, are pro-gay marriage, focused around money and the media.\"JUST WATCHEDCruz, Trump debate 'New York values'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCruz, Trump debate 'New York values' 01:37That led Trump to launch into a lengthy, emotional defense, pointing to New York City's response to the September 11, 2001, terror attacks.He said that \"the people of New York fought and fought and fought, and we saw more death -- the smell of death was with us for months.\"\"We rebuilt Downtown Manhattan, and everybody in the world watched and loved New York and loved New Yorkers,\" he said.Trump's response was moving, but to Cruz it was also predictable. That Cruz stuck with his \"New York values\" criticism anyway highlights his strategy as the campaign enters its final days: Cruz is heavily courting the evangelicals who dominate the GOP contests in Iowa and South Carolina.Trump-Cruz 'bromance' is overThe real four-man main stageTrump and Cruz were at the center of the night's most memorable exchanges, but Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie traded blows as well. JUST WATCHEDSen. Rubio and Gov. Christie's heated exchange ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSen. Rubio and Gov. Christie's heated exchange01:17Rubio accused Christie of supporting Common Core education standards, gun control laws and Planned Parenthood. Christie, echoing a Rubio comeback against Jeb Bush at a debate last fall, accused the senator of attacking him because he was advised it would work politically. Later, Christie interrupted a wonky tax policy exchange between Cruz and Rubio by shifting the discussion toward entitlements -- and swatting down Rubio's attempt to interject, saying: \"You already had your chance, Marco. You blew it.\"That Christie was even a target suggests he has a leg up on the two other governors in the race -- Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- for the lone ticket out of the New Hampshire primary, which looks likely to winnow the \"establishment\" crowd.GOP debate winners and losersThe debate raised a question: If Bush had a good night but no one paid attention, did he really have a good night?He hit Trump over his ban-all-Muslims proposal and trade, but Trump wouldn't talk policy and dismissed him with a line that demonstrated why he's so often gotten the best of the former Florida governor, saying: \"We don't need a weak person as president of the United States, OK? ... That's essentially what we have now, and we don't need that.\" Kasich, meanwhile, got the most engagement of the night from 89-year-old former Democratic Rep. John Dingell, who tweeted: \"John Kasich tells more \"back in my day\" rocking chair stories than me or anyone I know, and I was born during the Coolidge administration.\"John Kasich tells more \"back in my day\" rocking chair stories than me or anyone I know, and I was born during the Coolidge administration.\u2014 John Dingell (@JohnDingell) January 15, 2016Marco's late saveCruz thanked Rubio for \"dumping your oppo-research book on the debate stage\" -- and that's exactly what Rubio had just done.More than two hours into the debate, Rubio saved what had been a mostly lifeless night by unloading a combination of punches on Cruz.He hit Cruz on immigration, trade and voting against Department of Defense funding -- and in doing so, he alluded to a potentially damaging theme against Cruz: That he's willing to say and do anything to win.\"That is not consistent conservatism, that is political calculation,\" Rubio said.Cruz fought back, arguing that Rubio had distorted his record at every turn and saying Rubio had allied with Democrats like Sen. Chuck Schumer while he sided with Republicans like Sen. Jeff Sessions on immigration.An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll out Thursday showed exactly why the two are fighting. In a two-way race between Trump and Cruz, Cruz wins, 51% to 43%. But in a three-way race, Trump wins, with 40% to Cruz's 31% and Rubio's 26% -- suggesting that the two can't co-exist.Fact-checking the candidates' claimsObama's third presidential campaignIt's probably not surprising two days after the State of the Union address, but President Barack Obama was at the center of the debate. The first question from Maria Bartiromo invited Cruz to take a shot at Obama's management of the economy -- and the Texas senator decided to also take a swipe at the President over Iranian TV pictures of the captured US naval crew on their knees with their hands on their heads. Cruz and Christie subsequently both described the President as \"a child.\"There's no reason to expect the Obama talk to subside between now and November. With his approval ratings in the mid-40s, Republicans think he's unpopular enough to be a liability for Democrats, especially when they mention him with Hillary Clinton in the same sentence. But at the same time, his high popularity among Democrats means that barring a huge slump in his favorability ratings, there's good reason for the eventual Democratic nominee not to run too far away from him either.

That's changed, however, as the polls in Iowa tighten ahead of the February 1 caucuses. Trump, hoping to eat into the senator's support in Iowa, has repeatedly questioned whether Cruz, whose mother was a U.S. citizen, is a natural born citizen. But in his attack against Trump on Thursday, Cruz noted that some of the more extreme theories on the topic would conclude that someone can only become president if both parents were born in the United States. Under that standard, Cruz noted, Trump himself would be ineligible for the presidency because his mother was born in Scotland.\"On the issue of citizenship, Donald, I'm not going to use your mother's birth against you,\" Cruz said.Trump shot back: \"Because it wouldn't work.\"It wasn't just Trump who put Cruz on the defensive.

In fact, in recent months the United States has begun to take steps to review social media postings of visa applicants from certain countries.The value of these social media searches is limited, since terrorist sympathizers can conceal their identities online or use privacy settings to hide their posts.In fact, San Bernardino shooter Tashfeen Malik obscured her identity when making pro-jihad comments on social media sites and used enhanced security settings, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN this week.Some of Malik's postings were only visible to a small group of friends, which runs in direct contrast to Cruz's suggestion that Malik made the statements publicly.Verdict: FalseChris ChristieReality Check: Christie on King Hussein of JordanBy Lisa Rose, CNNSeeking to highlight his muscular approach to foreign policy, demonstrate his command of Middle East politics and tout his people skills, New Jersey Gov.

Unlike the other services, the Air Force did not grow during the post-9/11 buildup. The reduction in capacity is expected to continue in the future due to continued budgetary pressure. Under sequestration, the Air Force will shrink to 26 tactical aircraft (TACAIR) squadrons.\"As far as the Air Force being the \"oldest and smallest,\" that is likely referring to the age and total inventory of aircraft in the fleet. An April 2014 study by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments described Air Force aircraft as \"the smallest and oldest the service has ever fielded.\" The study noted that in 2014, the average age of an Air Force fighter jet was 24 years, and that of a bomber was 38 years. The inventory of fighters was 2,010, down from 7,456 in 1955. The U.S. Air Force was formally created in 1947, following World War II, when it was still part of the Army.Verdict: TrueReality Check: Rubio on a weaker NSABy Jose Pagliery, CNNMoneySen. Marco Rubio warned that new limits on National Security Agency spying has made it slow at getting phone records to keep track of terrorism suspects.\"This metadata program is actually more strict than what a regular law enforcement agency has now. If a regular law enforcement agency wants your phone records, all they have to do is issue a subpoena.\"\"But now the intelligence agency is not able to quickly gather records and look at them to see who these terrorists are calling.\"That's incorrect. The FBI and NSA can still quickly acquire call records, and in an emergency, they can do so immediately without any court approval.Rubio is referring to the USA Freedom Act, which passed this summer. That law revamped the controversial NSA bulk phone record collection program.Previously, a secret federal court granted NSA ongoing access to phone company customer records. Those phone records were kept at NSA for a long period of time.Now, they're kept at phone companies. But companies decide how long to keep them. And NSA can still access them, but it must first get a judge's approval from the special Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.JUST WATCHEDNSA stops collecting your phone data ... for nowReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHNSA stops collecting your phone data ... for now 05:26But there's a lot of leeway here. NSA can claim \"exigent circumstances\" and tap into the \"emergency provisions\" under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The agency can demand records directly from phone companies, quickly get them, then get court approval later.Notably, Rubio also mentioned that investigators should have had access to the phone records of the San Bernardino mass shooter, Syed Rizwan Farook.\"The terrorist that attacked us in San Bernardino was an American citizen, born and raised in this country. And I bet you we wish we had access to five years of his records, so we could see who he was working with before they carry out another attack,\" he said.Actually, the FBI and NSA might still have access to the terrorists' past phone call records. They have to ask whatever phone carrier the shooters used.The question now is whether the company kept 18 months of records or more. And given that the shooters already committed a crime, any judge would approve it.In conclusion, Rubio is wrong.Verdict: FalseJohn KasichReality Check: Kasich on encryptionBy Kate Grise, CNNOhio Gov. John Kasich said, \"The people in San Bernardino were communicating with people who the FBI had been watching, but because their phone was encrypted, because the intelligence officials could not see who they were talking to, it was lost. We have to solve the encryption problem.\"Tashfeen Malik advocated jihad in messages on social media, but her comments were made under a pseudonym and with strict privacy settings that did not allow people outside a small group of friends to see them, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN on Monday.A U.S. official told CNN that the United States only recently began reviewing the social media activity of visa applicants from certain countries. The date that these types of reviews began is not clear, but it was after Malik's application was considered, the source said.FBI Director James Comey did not specify if encrypted communications played a role in the San Bernardino massacre when speaking to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. However, Comey seemed to be in agreement with Kasich that encryption can be an obstacle and urged the tech industry to allow decryption of data under a court order.Some in the tech industry insist that encryption is necessary to protect people who use their products. \"We believe very strongly in end-to-end encryption and no backdoors,\" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an interview with the London Daily Telegraph. \"We don't think people want us to read their messages. We don't feel we have the right to read their emails.\"Encryption is not the reason the couples' posts were not being monitored. Rather, they were private communications, both by phone and social media, and the U.S. government was not monitoring them because they had no reason to. The couple were not on any terrorist watchlists, and Malik made her comments under a fake name behind many privacy settings that would have required a warrant to access them.Verdict: FalseDonald TrumpReality Check: Trump wants to shut down the Internet in Iraq and Syria to help stem terrorismBy Tami Luhby, Jose Pagliery and David Goldman, CNNMoney\"We're not talking about closing the Internet. I'm talking about parts of Syria, parts of Iraq. Where ISIS is. Now, you could close it,\" businessman Donald Trump said.It actually is possible to shut down the Internet.

Egypt limited access during the 2011 Arab Spring uprising.JUST WATCHEDDonald Trump clarifies Internet commentsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDonald Trump clarifies Internet comments 01:41But for America to shut down the Internet in Iraq and Syria would be a very complicated task. The United States does not control the global Internet or servers on foreign soil.RELATED: Donald Trump wants to 'close up' the InternetSo foreign Internet infrastructure would need to be disrupted or shut down to turn off service in certain areas -- a tricky task made even harder if the countries and companies controlling those servers and cell towers don't cooperate.If those countries didn't comply, America would have to take out the servers and towers through the use of force, possibly involving ground troops to find and destroy this infrastructure. The U.S. would have to jam all space satellites -- or demand satellite operators not provide service to Iraq and Syria.Another complication: Shutting down the Internet in Iraq and Syria would eliminate intelligence gathering from phone calls, emails and other electronic communication coming from Syria and Iraq, rendering the National Security Agency effectively blind and deaf.Verdict: True, but not likely to happen.Reality Check: Trump on $150 billion in unfrozen Iranian assetsBy Eve Bower, CNNBusinessman Donald Trump criticized the Iranian nuclear deal, calling it \"that horrible, disgusting, absolutely incompetent deal with Iran where they get $150 billion.\"In 2011 and 2012, the United States and Europe imposed sanctions on Iran that included freezing some Iranian assets overseas. With the announcement of a nuclear deal in 2015, those same assets stand to be released, creating a pool of money that will be newly available to the Iranian government. The total amount of those assets is not known, but as a deal with Iran seemed imminent, some estimated that the number was as high as $150 billion.In late July, at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the deal, House Speaker John Boehner and others claimed that \"more than $100 billion\" in unfrozen assets would be available to Iran.Both the Department of the Treasury and the White House have disputed these estimates.In Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew's July testimony to the Senate, he estimated that, after sanctions relief, Iran will only be able to access \"about $50 billion\" in unfrozen assets. He noted that another large portion -- about $20 billion -- was tied up in projects with China, and \"tens of billions\" comprise nonperforming loans to Iranian energy and banking interests.In a detailed statement on the deal, the White House later called the $150 billion estimate \"entirely off base.\"Because none of the parties with access to the assets have substantiated an estimate anywhere close to the figure Trump suggests, this assertion is deemed False.Reality Check: Trump on San Bernardino shootersBy Jamie Crawford, CNNSpeaking about the attack in San Bernardino, California, Donald Trump claimed \"numerous people, including the mother, knew what was going on. They saw a pipe bomb sitting all over the floor. They saw ammunition all over the place. They knew exactly what was going on.\"It is true that the apartment of the shooters, Syed Rizwan Farook and Tashfeen Malik, contained a large amount of firepower and weapons. In a briefing with reporters after the attack, San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan spoke about hundreds of rounds of ammunition being found in the SUV used by the shooters as well as in their apartment. Authorities also found 12 pipe bombs in the apartment and hundreds of tools that \"could be used to construct IEDs or pipe bombs,\" Burguan said.There were 19 devices in all that were found, some that were not finished.JUST WATCHEDFBI: No clues found in San Bernardino lakeReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFBI: No clues found in San Bernardino lake 02:31David Chesley, an attorney representing the family of Farook in California, said Farook's mother lived in an isolated part of the residence the couple rented. On the day of the attack, the couple left their baby with her. But U.S. officials have yet to come to a conclusion about the extent of what Farook's mother knew or was aware of, and it is a still a matter of investigation. \"Obviously, it's something that we're looking at very, very closely,\" U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" earlier this month.To date, no law enforcement official at this point has said that Farook's mother was aware of the arsenal that Farook and Malik were amassing in the home they shared with Farook's mother.Verdict: FalseCarly FiorinaReality Check: Fiorina on generals retiring earlyBy Lisa Rose, CNNWhile describing the steps she would take to confront ISIS overseas, Carly Fiorina said that she would call in former military leaders including Gen. Stanley McChrystal and Gen. David Petraeus, both of whom \"retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn't want to hear.\"Although McChrystal and Petraeus may have said things the President didn't want to hear, their early departures were not prompted by contentious conversations with Obama.McChrystal resigned in 2010 after Rolling Stone published a profile in which he mocked members of the Obama administration, including Vice President Joe Biden and then-Afghanistan adviser Richard Holbrooke.Petraeus resigned as CIA director in 2012 after an FBI investigation revealed that he was having an affair with Paula Broadwell, a woman who was writing a book about him. He pleaded guilty to sharing classified information with Broadwell and was sentenced to two years of probation.Verdict: FalseReality Check: Fiorina on tech companies cooperating with FBIBy Jose Pagliery, CNNMoneyFormer Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina was asked whether tech companies should be forced to cooperate with the FBI to expose terrorists' communications.Fiorina said: \"They do not need to be forced. They need to be asked ... they have not been asked.\"That's not true. The FBI has indeed asked all major tech companies -- Apple, Google, Microsoft, and others -- to help them spy on terrorists.But so far, the only proposal the FBI has made would turn the modern world upside down. According to many experts in the field, it would undermine the safety of all communications.That's because terrorists are using encryption -- the same thing that protects your email and banking from hackers.The FBI wants tech companies to give law enforcement an extra set of keys to locked communications.JUST WATCHEDCarly Fiorina's career historyReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCarly Fiorina's career history 02:29But encryption only works because it keeps everyone out. If Apple creates iPhones that have a \"back door,\" hackers can get in, too. If a company keeps an extra set of keys lying around to spy on employees, Chinese hackers can grab them to break into company data.Encryption is math. Cryptographers are its mathematicians. They all agree that any extra access is dangerous to everyone.The world's top cryptographers issued a joint statement in July, calling the FBI's attempts \"mandating insecurity.\" They describe this in binary terms: either data is secured against everyone, or it's not.\"This is a trade-off ... law enforcement cannot be guaranteed access without creating serious risk that criminal intruders will gain the same access,\" they said.At least 48 major companies and 37 civil society groups take a similar stand.In conclusion, so far, law enforcement has only given U.S. tech companies a devastating choice.Verdict: False, but it's complicated.Ted CruzReality Check: Cruz on legalization and amnestyBy Sonam Vashi, CNNSen. Marco Rubio said, \"Ted Cruz supported a 500% increase in the number of H-1B visas, the guest workers that are allowed in this country, and supports doubling the number of green cards.\"In response, Cruz said, \"I led the fight against (Rubio's) legalization and amnesty bill. ... I have never supported legalization and do not intend to support legalization.\"Cruz has been consistently against a pathway for citizenship for undocumented immigrants, and he has previously criticized plans for types of amnesty, but his statements Tuesday night are some of the clearest indications of his views on the issue.In 2013, Cruz filed additional amendments to immigration legislation that would have increased legal immigration. Although the amendments were ultimately unsuccessful, his amendments would have increased the H-1B visa cap from 65,000 to 325,000 (actually a 400% increase, but it's 500%, or five times, of the original. We'll chalk up the difference to a math mistake). It would also have doubled the worldwide green card caps from 675,000 visas annually to 1.35 million annually. Green cards allow foreign nationals to permanently live and work in the United States. However, another of those amendments specifically called for the bill not to give a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Last month, Cruz flipped, and said he no longer supported an increase in legal immigration. Cruz has been pretty consistent in his views toward undocumented immigrants, so we rate this claim as True. And likewise, we rate Rubio's claim True.Reality Check: Cruz on Syrian refugeesBy Sonam Vashi, CNNIn response to a question about Donald Trump's policy on Muslim travel to the U.S., Sen. Ted Cruz said, \"Even worse, President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees.\"Let's take a look:Since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, fewer than 2,500 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the U.S. More than half of those refugees are children, according to senior administration officials.In September, the White House announced it planned to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees this fiscal year. Shortly after that, Secretary of State John Kerry announced that the U.S. would increase the total number of migrants accepted from any country to 100,000 in 2017. Many of those additional migrants would likely be Syrian refugees, but it's unclear how many Syrian refugees over 10,000 the U.S. would accept.As for the FBI's inability to vet Syrian refugees: In October, FBI Director James Comey told Congress that Syrian refugees will be more difficult to check than those from many other countries, especially because the U.S. hasn't been regularly exchanging information with Syria. \"If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing showing up because we have no record of them,\" Comey said at the hearing.JUST WATCHEDMarco Rubio attacks Ted Cruz's voting recordReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHMarco Rubio attacks Ted Cruz's voting record 02:38However, it's incorrect to imply that the FBI said that it can't vet Syrian refugees. Refugees that come to the U.S. undergo several screenings, such as biographic checks and in-person interviews, which involve multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Syrian refugees in particular go through additional screening, called the Syria Enhanced Review process. That process uses biographical information collected from the U.N. refugee agency to determine whether an applicant needs to go through a fraud or national security unit, which then conducts individualized research on each applicant's story and records. Syrian refugee applications can take much longer to process than the average case processing time of 18 to 24 months. Mark Toner, a deputy State Department spokesman, recently called the refugee vetting process, \"the most stringent security process for anyone entering the United States.\"Cruz said \"tens of thousands\" of Syrian refugees will come to this country, but it's unclear how much more than 10,000 refugees the U.S. plans to accept. The FBI has admitted that there are serious challenges in screening Syrian refugees that come to the U.S., but refugees are vetted across multiple agencies in a process that is being constantly refined, according to senior State department officials.Verdict: FalseReality Check: Cruz on deportation recordsBy Kevin Liptak, CNN Demanding tougher enforcement of immigration laws, Sen. Ted Cruz cited the deportation records of previous presidents.\"You enforce the law,\" Cruz said. \"That means you stop the Obama administration's policy of releasing criminal illegal aliens. You know how many illegal aliens Bill Clinton deported? Twelve million. You know how many illegal aliens George W. Bush deported? Ten million.\"Those numbers are tricky, since \"deportation\" isn't an official law enforcement term used by the U.S. government. There are two types of ways that detained undocumented immigrants are forced to leave the country: \"removals,\" which require a court order, and \"returns,\" which occur when immigrants apprehended near the Mexican or Canadian border are told to turn back.When counting both \"removals\" and \"returns,\" 12.3 million undocumented immigrants were forced to leave the country under Clinton. The figure for Bush is close to 10 million, according to Homeland Security records.From the years 2009-2013 -- the years Obama has been in office where data is available -- 3.8 million undocumented immigrants were either \"removed\" or \"returned.\"Breaking down those statistics, Obama has relied far more heavily on \"removals,\" and is outpacing any previous commander-in-chief.Cruz is suggesting in his statement that Obama has been weaker on deportation than his two predecessors -- an assertion that doesn't stand up to figures showing Obama \"removing\" far more people than Clinton or Bush.But under his administration, there have been fewer \"returns\" since there have been fewer Mexicans or Canadians attempting to cross the southern or northern borders.Verdict: True, but misleadingGeorge PatakiReality Check: Pataki on Trump's Muslim ban for U.S. soldiersBy Eve Bower, CNNFormer New York Gov. George Pataki implied that Donald Trump had called for Muslim-American soldiers to be barred from re-entering the United States, saying, \"To target a religion and say that regardless of whether you're an American soldier [...] simply because of your religion we are going to ban you is un-American, it is unconstitutional, and it is wrong.\"This is a mischaracterization of the policy as Trump presented it.JUST WATCHEDFierce backlash over Trump's plan to ban MuslimsReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFierce backlash over Trump's plan to ban Muslims 02:11In a formal statement released on December 7, Trump called for a \"total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\"Later that evening, while speaking to Fox News, Trump was specifically asked how his policy would apply to Muslim members of the U.S. military. He said, \"They will come home,\" and, \"We have to take care of the Muslims that are living here. But we have to be vigilant.\"Verdict: FalseReality Check: Pataki on Muslim surveillance preventing \"dozens\" of attacksBy Lisa Rose, CNNFormer New York Gov. George Pataki declared that the New York Police Department's surveillance program that monitoredMuslim communities in New York and New Jersey \"stopped and prevented dozens and dozens of attacks in New York.\"The program, which dispatched undercover police officers to spy on mosques and Muslim-owned businesses, ended in April 2014. Contrary to Pataki's claim, the program didn't stop any attacks in New York, according to the head of the NYPD's intelligence division.There were some successes, however, including the 2010 bust of two New Jersey men who tried to travel overseas to join the terrorist group Al-Shabaab in Somalia. The men were not plotting domestic attacks.Authorities have thwarted two attacks in New York. In 2004, two men were charged with attempting to set off explosives in the Herald Square subway station. In 2010, a man tried to detonate a car bomb in Times Square. According to the NYPD, the surveillance program did not help stop either of those attacks. Verdict: FalseRick SantorumReality Check: Santorum on the NSA's canceled phone record spyingBy Jose Pagliery, CNNMoneyCongress recently ended the National Security Agency's controversial phone record spying program.Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said the United States should bring it back. He said: \"This metadata collection is not collecting people's phone calls, their voices. They're not collecting information that's personal. There's no names attached to these numbers.\"He also described this information as \"anonymous.\"Santorum is right. This NSA program was limited.For a decade, the NSA collected phone records in bulk from major American companies like AT&T and Verizon. It was granted this ability by Section 215 of the Patriot Act.Santorum correctly described the limitations of the NSA program. According to declassified intelligence court documents, it only allowed the NSA to collect phone numbers, a cell network identifier, the time and duration of calls. This information -- called telephone metadata -- does not include names.However, this information was not anonymous. There are two dimensions to this.First, it's easy for the NSA to identify those phone numbers on the back end. Intelligence officials regularly demand customer data from companies in secret, using something called a \"National Security Letter.\"Second, phone metadata allows the NSA to map our entire personal networks.\"The NSA could tell that you called your pastor, or a suicide hotline,\" said American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Neema Singh Guliani.That's why Sen. Mike Lee of Utah has described this as the \"bulk collection of personal data.\"In short, the NSA's bulk phone collection didn't give the agency people's names -- but it gave the government a major first step in identifying everyone's personal networks.Verdict: True, but misleadingLindsey GrahamReality Check: Graham on ISIS in nine countriesBy Kate Grise, CNNSen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said: \"I want to find out what do we need militarily to keep them contained and eventually destroy them in Libya? They're in nine countries. You want to deal with Libya. Go to Iraq or Syria. You want to prevent another 9/11, take the caliphate headquarters away from ISIL.\"ISIS and its affiliates have carried out attacks in 11 countries in addition to their terror in Iraq and Syria. The group has carried out attacks in France, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Kuwait, and Lebanon.The November terror attacks in Paris were the sole incident in Europe. The group has hit Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Lebanon and Kuwait once each. ISIS and its affiliates are believed to have carried out multiple attacks in Libya, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia.In reality, Graham is slightly underestimating ISIS's reach. It has taken control of territory or carried out organized terror attacks in at least 13 countries. But the substance of what Graham is saying is accurate.Verdict: TrueMike HuckabeeReality Check: Huckabee on surveillance of religious institutionsBy Sonam Vashi, CNNFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee said: \"You can go to any church in America. It's a public place ... So if it's a public place and people are invited to come, how does it violate anybody's First Amendment rights if somebody shows up because they might want to listen in and see, is there something that is a little nefarious? And if there is, then you take the second step, getting a search warrant. You do what you have to do. That's all protected under the Constitution.\"There's no clear-cut answer here, but the FBI and other law enforcement organizations have legally monitored mosques in the past.Last year, a federal judge threw out a case regarding the New York City Police Department's secret surveillance program, which included monitoring mosques, Muslim businesses, and other organizations. The court found that the NYPD program did not violate the Constitution, since it had been focused on anti-terrorism, not anti-Muslim, activities.However, in October, a U.S. appeals court reversed the decision, allowing the plaintiffs suing the NYPD to continue with their lawsuit. A verdict on that case is awaiting trial.Based on prior surveillance programs and the legal limbo of the NYPD program, which could determine the constitutionality of such monitoring, we rate Huckabee's claim as Mostly True.Reality Check: Huckabee on military sizeBy Kevin Liptak, CNNFormer Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee claimed that the country's \"biggest mistake we've made militarily is letting Barack Obama cut our defense forces by 25% and leaving us at the least prepared position we've been in since before World War II.\"Huckabee's claims that Obama has cut military forces by a quarter don't match enrollment figures provided by the Department of Defense. In 2008, the year before Obama took office, the total number of people enlisted in the U.S. military -- across all branches -- stood at 1,401,757.Data for the latest year, 2014, show the number has decreased to 1,338,487 -- a 4% decrease.Obama has overseen declines in defense spending, spurred partly by his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, but also by mandatory, across-the-board spending cuts that went into effect in 2011 when Congress failed to arrive at a budget deal.Estimates on exactly how much that spending has decreased vary based on what's included in the calculation, and range anywhere from 15% to 25%.Obama has sought to replace sequestration, those forced cuts, which he insists puts the U.S. in a weakened position militarily. And he recently proposed a budget plan increasing military spending by almost 8%.While Huckabee is correct that the military has shrunk under Obama, his assertion that defense forces have been slashed by 25% doesn't stand up to scrutiny.Verdict: FalseReality Check: Huckabee asserts movie \"Casablanca\" ends with walk into sunsetBy Richard T. Griffiths, CNNIn making an assertion about trusting Russian President Vladimir Putin, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee compares the relationship to the close of the movie \"Casablanca,\" suggesting Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, and the police captain, played by Claude Rains, walk off into the sunset. \"Do I think we can hug Putin and have a wonderful relationship with the Russians and go off into the sunset like the end of 'Casablanca?'

We can capture their sailors and we can make them get on their knees, we can humiliate them,\" he said on Fox News' \"On the Record with Greta Van Susteren.\"\u200b\"Do you know why they did this? Because they know they can get away with it. Because they know Barack Obama is weak.\"With the administration suddenly on the defensive, State Department spokesman John Kirby told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"The Lead\" that the videos were \"hard to look at\" but urged critics to concentrate on the fact that the sailors were returned quickly.\"What we are most happy about here in the State Department is that we were able to get them home in less than 24 hours, (with) 10 fingers, 10 toes, nobody hurt. They are all safe and we got our boats back, and I think that is the most important thing.\"White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters, meanwhile, that the President had seen the pictures of the American sailors with their hands on their heads and expected to get a full briefing on the incident.In a few tense hours on Tuesday, the crisis had threatened to prove a major political embarrassment for Obama, particularly since the sailors were being held while he delivered his final State of the Union address. He didn't mention the captives while he was speaking, instead highlighting the Iran nuclear deal as a top legacy achievement.Pressed into crisis mode, Secretary of State John Kerry led U.S. diplomacy to free the sailors. He spoke five times by telephone to Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, with whom he bonded during tortuous negotiations last year over the nuclear deal.Kerry told Zarif that \"if we are able to do this in the right way, we can make this into what will be a good story for both of us,\" a senior State Department official told reporter.With the crisis resolved, Kerry thanked Iran on Wednesday and chalked up a victory for the administration.\"In fact, it is clear that today, this kind of issue was able to be peacefully resolved and efficiently resolved and that is a testament to the critical role that diplomacy plays in keeping our country safe and strong,\" he said.JUST WATCHEDVideo shows U.S. sailor apologizing to IranReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHVideo shows U.S. sailor apologizing to Iran 01:25On Air Force One on Tuesday, Obama spokesman Josh Earnest said that the President's decision not to raise the issue during the speech -- despite demands from hawkish Republicans -- to avoid upsetting delicate diplomacy had helped resolve the crisis.There was precedent for such a standoff to further deteriorate. Back in 2007, Iran held 15 British sailors and Marines and accused them of trespassing in its territorial waters. In an acute embarrassment for the British government, the service members were paraded before then-President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and critics said their apologies were extracted under duress.It is partly the knowledge of past Iranian behavior that has skeptics doubting the administration's claim of a diplomatic victory, especially at the time when Tehran is projecting its power throughout the region and worrying U.S allies.Critics pointed out that with Iran set to get more than $100 billion in sanctions relief with the implementation of the nuclear deal, Tehran had plenty of incentives other than succumbing to American diplomatic pressure to bring the standoff to a quick resolution.\"What's remarkable to me is with $100 billion-plus imminent, the Iranians continue to act with impunity in provoking the administration,\" said Mark Dubowitz, a sanctions expert with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies.READ: Video shows American sailor apologizing for Iran incidentSuch provocations include recent ballistic missile tests that the U.N. says infringed a Security Council resolution, the holding of several Americans inside Iran, close calls with the U.S Navy in the Persian Gulf, intensification of the proxy war against Saudi Arabia and a doubling down of support for Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad. 18 photos: The U.S. Navy's riverine command boats18 photos: The U.S. Navy's riverine command boatsA U.S. riverine command boat patrols the Persian Gulf on November 2.

Let's learn from this latest example,\" he said.READ: Supreme Court hears Iran victims' compensation caseHowever, Iranian internal politics are notoriously opaque and it would not be surprising if the capture of the sailors was a symptom of power struggles within the country. Political tensions are acute in the run-up to crucial elections next month for the country's parliament, the Majlis, and a powerful body called the Assembly of Experts that has the power to appoint the Supreme leader.The IRGC has been much more critical of the nuclear deal than the political leadership, and some see this incident as an effort to assert their authority.A desire to avoid embarrassing Zarif and President Hassan Rouhani and to provide ammunition to hardline opponents of the nuclear deal may be one reason why the U.S. administration has yet to impose promised sanctions over the missile tests.\"What happened with the sailors, to me, is an indication that the Revolutionary Guards are sending a message to Obama and to Rouhani that they are in charge,\" Dubowitz said.\"The deal may have been negotiated with Rouhani and Zarif, but it will be the Revolutionary Guards who will dictate the terms and dictate the implementation.\"Under this interpretation of the events in the Persian Gulf, the IRGC made their point at a critical moment before Obama's State of the Union and had no need to overplay their hand by keeping the sailors.And steeped in Iranian business dealings, they personally have much to gain by the easing of sanctions to take place if the nuclear deal's implementation goes ahead as planned.", "article_highlights": "The sailors' release after less than 24 hours left the implementation of the Iran nuclear deal intactThe crisis had threatened to prove a major political embarrassment for Obama", "article_author": "Stephen Collinson, CNN"}

Obama issued a statement condemning the killing of the Christians on Sunday night, though Obama's Republican opponents have consistently made the case that the growing Islamic State threat is exacerbated by what they see as his weak leadership.

Independents, meanwhile, are split, with 48% in favor and 50% opposed.The prospect of sending in ground troops remains a sticking point for both congressional Democrats and Republicans in the debate over Obama's Authorization for the Use of Military Force, which would give him legal authority to combat ISIS.But the AUMF, and Obama's decision to go to Congress for the official authority to continue battling ISIS, is widely popular, according to the new poll.Seventy-eight percent of Americans say Congress should give Obama the authority to fight ISIS, a slight decline from 82% who supported it in December. A similarly large majority say Obama was right to ask Congress for the authority, rather than proceeding with the battle unilaterally.The survey was conducted among 1,027 adult Americans from Feb. 12-15, and has a margin of sampling error of 3%.Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Alexandra Jaffe, CNN"}

First he'd said going to war with the intelligence available in 2003 wasn't a mistake; then he'd said he wouldn't answer hypotheticals; finally he acknowledged that, knowing the facts now, he wouldn't have made the decision his brother, President George W. Bush, made to invade. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who's advocated a less interventionist foreign policy than other Republican candidates, was Bush's sharpest critic. \"I think it's an important question and I don't think it's a historical anecdote. I don't think it's something that's a hypothetical question,\" he said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"I think it's a recurring question in the Middle East: Is it a good idea to topple secular dictators? And what happens when we do?\"\"I think when Hussein was toppled, we got chaos,\" Paul said. \"We still have chaos in Iraq. I think it emboldened Iran. I think -- we now have the rise of radical Islam in Iraq as well.\" JUST WATCHEDA Walker-Rubio ticket?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHA Walker-Rubio ticket? 00:46He said Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton should face similar questions about the United States intervention in Libya. \"We're gonna have to have this debate, not only in the Republican primary but in the general, as to whether or not it's a good idea,\" Paul said. \"Is intervention always a good idea? Or sometimes does it lead to unintended consequences?\"Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said on CBS's \"Face the Nation\" that foreign policy will be \"an important part\" of the 2016 campaign. He said that knowing Iraq did not have weapons of mass destruction, it's \"safe for many of us, myself included, to say we probably wouldn't have taken that tack.\" Still, he added: \"I think any president, regardless of party, would have made a similar decision to what President Bush did at the time with the information he had available.\" Walker also hit President Barack Obama for pulling American troops out of Iraq, saying that \"we have a very destabilized region and we need to have a strong presence there.\" Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Eric Bradner, CNN"}

'Extraordinarily proud'\"I know I'm going to have to get beyond being George H.W. Bush's son and Barbara's son -- for which I'm really proud. And I'm going to get beyond being George W.'s brother for which I am extraordinarily proud as well,\" Bush said to applause Thursday night. \"There's a lot of interest in finding the ways that we are different and all this. Well, the simple fact is that we're all on our own life's journey -- my brothers and sister are different than me,\" Bush said. \"But I'm not going to go out of my way to say that my brother did this wrong or my dad this wrong. It's just not going to happen. I have a hard time with that. I love my family a lot.Before going on to sketch his biography for the crowd, he added: \"I'm going to have to show my heart, show who I am, tell my life story so people know that I'm doing this for the right reason.\" It was an answer many of Bush's allies and donors wished the former Florida governor had given days ago. Instead the would-be candidate -- who has drawn tens of millions of dollars to his potential effort in large part because he was supposed to be the one who was steady and polished -- ended up in a quagmire of his own making. Bush and Clinton confront family legaciesRather than showing the kind of raw political talent and instincts that made his brother shine in 2000, the younger Bush confirmed this week what many observers have seen over the years: Jeb Bush has difficulty answering in sound bites. Where George W. Bush labeled himself a \"uniter, not a divider,\" Jeb Bush takes more time to formulate his answers and thoughts on the issues -- a luxury that he had during a very different kind of media cycle a decade ago when he was last running for public office.Explaining his reluctance to talk about Iraq, he said Thursday that as Florida's governor, he had called \"over 100 family members who lost a loved one in service to our great country.\" It was not \"an easy thing to do,\" he said.\"It's very hard for me to say their lives were lost in vain. In fact, they weren't,\" Bush said. \"Their sacrifice is worth honoring, not depreciating. And I believe that in the bottom of my heart.\"He dismissed his assertion earlier this week that he wouldn't answer \"hypothetical\" questions when he said he would not have gone into Iraq if he had known about the faulty intelligence that led to the invasion.\"That's not to say the world is safer because Saddam Hussein is gone. It's significantly safer,\" he added, defending the actions of his brother. \"That's not to say that there was a courageous effort to bring about a surge that created stability in Iraq.All of that is true, and that's not to say that the men and women that have served in uniform and many others that went to Iraq to serve.\"A number of Republican political operatives expressed relief after Bush's final answer Thursday -- saying that his clarification would help him move on to the issues that he actually wants to talk about.'Glimpse of who the person is'Steve Duprey, a New Hampshire committeeman, said it was one of the episodes on the campaign trail \"where we get a glimpse of who the person is.\"\"It's those moments when voters get to take the measure of a person,\" said Duprey, who was attending this week's Republican National Committee meeting in Phoenix. \"I think people understood -- obviously he loves his father; he loves his brother; he's loyal to them, but he's his own person and I think he did a good job showing that.\"Ron Kaufman, who advised George H. W. Bush and was wearing a \"Jeb!\" wristwatch at the GOP gathering, argued that voters would ultimately come to see the closeness of the Bush family as an asset.\"Presidents don't talk to presidents enough,\" Kaufman said. \"Whether they agree or not is not the point -- they've been there, they've been at the decision-making point where no one else has ever been.... Not using that resource? Shame on any future president who doesn't -- particularly if he's your brother.\"It's getting harder for Jeb Bush to pretend he's not running for presidentBut that did not mean that other potential rivals were willing to let the issue go. \"I don't know how that was a hard question,\" former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum told reporters after speaking at the convention in Scottsdale.Santorum suggested he might be a better candidate than Bush since he had been through the process before and noted that he had answered the Iraq question \"a hundred times.\" \"If you are not prepared for it, I think we've seen in the past, you are not going to do very, very well,\" he said. \"This is a long process.\"Santorum added: \"I don't know how anyone could look at that question and not -- I mean his brother even said in his own book that he would have done something differently.\" The biggest risk for Bush stemming from this episode could be reinforcing a sense of fatigue among voters with his family's history in politics -- a challenge that, of course, Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton is also facing.\"We've had enough Bushes,\" said Ken Fipps of Johns Island, South Carolina, who listened to Bush's speech at the state's GOP convention earlier this month. \"We're America. We don't have a nobility.\"Stuart Kimball, a limousine driver who attended Bush's town hall in Reno, Nevada, on Wednesday, said if Bush wins the nomination, he'll have to \"hold a clothespin over\" his nose and vote for him over Clinton. \"Nobody loves what his brother has done,\" he added. \"I feel like I got to apologize to the American people for voting twice\" for George W. Bush.Sharpening skillsBut other Republicans were more forgiving -- noting that it is only May 2015 and that Bush has plenty of time to sharpen his skills as a candidate.Ari Fleischer, George W. Bush's first White House press secretary, noted that the familial comparisons were \"a well worn path\" for the Bush family.Fleischer, for example, dealt with questions about George H.W. Bush's legacy when he was spokesman for George W. Bush's 2000 campaign.The family ties \"will be of press interest for much of the campaign,\" Fleischer said, \"up until the point where Jeb -- by virtue of releasing his own policy initiatives, giving powerful speeches and taking stands that are Jeb Bush stands on contemporaneous issues -- will make it go away.\"21 photos: Jeb Bush's lifeFormer Florida Gov.

Mega Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, whose major priority is the security of Israel, called former Ambassador Mel Sembler, a major financial backer of Bush's, to complain about Baker, the New York Times reported. Following that speech last month Bush tried to put some distance between himself and the former Secretary of State. Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell told CNN Bush \"has a great deal of respect\" for Baker but disagreed with some of the policies supported by J Street and said \"Governor Bush's support for Israel and Prime Minister Netanyahu is unwavering.\" She said Bush believes the U.S. and Israel should work \"seamlessly to achieve peace.\" Baker, who served in various positions in the Reagan and Bush 41 administrations and had disagreements with Netanyahu during that time, has been close to the Bush family for decades, especially with Jeb's father, George Herbert Walker Bush. \"I'm going to be working hard for Jeb Bush because I think he's clearly the cream of the crop of the Republicans who are going to run for the nomination,\" he told Zakaria.\"I've known him since he was a young man. I know what kind of President he would be. He would be an extraordinarily good President. He's very knowledgeable. He's very temperamental. He's suited for the job.\"On a lighter note Zakaria asked Baker what did Barbara Bush mean, apparently referring to 2013 when she was asked on NBC's \"Today\" whether she wanted her son Jeb to run for president. \"I think it's a great country. There are a lot of great families, and it's not just four families or whatever. There are other people out there that are very qualified, and we've had enough Bushes\" adding though her son was the best qualified. Once it became clear in the past few months Jeb was seriously considering running she said her earlier opinion was wrong. \"You think I would answer a question about what did Barbara Bush mean? I spent years not answering questions like that,\" Baker quipped.Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Kevin Bohn, CNN"}

Under the new nuclear deal, Iran will be able to conduct ballistic missile tests -- a concession to Iran included in the deal -- meaning Iran could have simply waited until after implementation of the deal to do the test.Verdict: True -- Iran violated the sanctions, but not the nuclear weapons agreementMarco RubioReality Check: Rubio on Cruz's opposition to ethanolBy Theodore Schleifer, CNNSen. Marco Rubio of Florida claimed that Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas flipped on his support for ethanol, just one attack in a rapid-fire succession of them, but also the one that could matter the most in Iowa, which is a leading corn producer.Cruz has always opposed the Renewable Fuel Standard, the fuel mandate supported by the state's ethanol interests, calling it an example of corporate welfare pushed by \"lobbyists and Democrats.\" It's an issue that Cruz has taken flak over all across Iowa, with voters frequently questioning him at town halls and retail stops concerned about his view.JUST WATCHEDRubio to Cruz: We all saw you flip your voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRubio to Cruz: We all saw you flip your vote 02:00Cruz admits that he did co-sponsor a 2013 bill that would've ended the RFS immediately. But his current position, as outlined in a 2014 comprehensive energy bill he introduced in the Senate, is to phase it out over five years, with his policy as of now to end the RFS by 2022.The ethanol lobby sending negative mailers about Cruz's record says that he did flip, but Cruz denies that, pointing to his bill instead of the one he co-sponsored. Cruz's personal preference, however, has always been for a five-year phase-out.Verdict: FalseReality Check: Rubio says Obamacare is a certified job killerBy Tami Luhby and Kate Grise, CNNRubio said that Obamacare is \"a certified job killer.\"In fact, Obamacare is not a job killer, according to the 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation/Health Research and Education Trust survey released in September 2015.The report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. In fact, that study showed that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.An ADP Research Institute study had similar findings.One reason may be that the economy has been improving. Some companies interviewed by ADP said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.As to whether employers are cutting jobs because of Obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from Labor Department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. The number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.Verdict: FalseMarco Rubio and Chris ChristieReality Check: Rubio claims Christie supported Sonia SotomayorBy Marshall Cohen, CNNSen. Marco Rubio took a swipe at Chris Christie when he said the New Jersey governor backed President Barack Obama's nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court in 2009. Christie hastily denied the accusation.But looking back at the record, Christie did in fact support Sotomayor's nomination. It was July 2009, and Christie locked in a tight race for governor of New Jersey, a Democratic-leaning state. Perhaps in an attempt to appeal to moderate voters, Christie said \"elections have consequences\" and threw his support behind Obama's nominee. \"While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice, President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability, competence and ability,\" Christie said at the time. \"I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination.\"Verdict: Rubio's claim is true, and Christie's is falseReality Check: Rubio accuses Christie of donating to Planned ParenthoodBy Marshall Cohen, CNNJUST WATCHEDSen. Rubio and Gov. Christie's heated exchange ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHSen. Rubio and Gov. Christie's heated exchange01:17Rubio also accused Christie of donating to Planned Parenthood, a highly contentious allegation, especially considering the effort among conservatives to strip the organization of its federal funds.After the allegations first surfaced, The (Newark) Star-Ledger unearthed a 1994 article where Christie, who was running at the time for a position in county government, said, \"I support Planned Parenthood privately with my personal contribution and that should be the goal of any such agency, to find private donations.\"But in the past week, Christie insisted that he was misquoted in the old article: \"This is a quote from 21 years ago. I'm convinced it was a misquote,\" Christie told The Washington Post. \" Understand what was going on. In 1994-95, I was fighting against county funding of Planned Parenthood even though I was pro-choice.\"So it's true that Christie once said he donated to Planned Parenthood, and Rubio and his allies are holding that article up as proof. But Christie claims the quote was inaccurate. So given the \"he said, he said\" situation, it's difficult to know for sure where the truth lies.Verdict: It's complicatedDonald TrumpReality Check: Trump says Paris has the \"strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world\"By Ryan Browne, CNNDonald Trump said the terrorist attacks in Paris last year happened despite the city having \"the strictest no-gun policy of any city anywhere in the world.\"However, in France, private gun ownership, while heavily regulated, is permitted.According to French law, to get any category one or four weapons, like a Glock pistol, you need to be 21, to have joined a shooting range for the last six months, provided a blank criminal record and a certificate of physical and mental health not older than two weeks. Then, the local police precinct starts a \"morality investigation\" in your neighborhood, according to French journalist Phillipe Coste.While French laws are restrictive, the gun laws in the UK are even more so. After a series of mass shootings in the 1980s and 1990s, the UK passed a law effectively banning the private ownership of all handguns.According to the UK government's Home Office 2015 \"Guide on Firearms Licensing Law,\" the British Firearms Act of 1968 and its 1997 modification \"has meant the prohibition of handguns.\"Verdict: FalseTrump-Cruz 'bromance is overReality Check: Trump on law professor about CruzBy Kevin Liptak, CNNIn defending his questioning of Sen. Ted Cruz's eligibility for the presidency, Donald Trump cited Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe, who Trump claimed is raising \"a serious question to whether or not Ted can do this.\"Although Tribe has weighed in on Cruz's eligibility, he has not outright questioned whether Cruz -- who was born in Canada to an American mother and a Cuban father -- would be considered a \"natural born citizen,\" the definition of which Tribe says is \"completely unsettled.\"JUST WATCHEDTrump to Cruz: You're a liability as a candidateReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTrump to Cruz: You're a liability as a candidate 02:07What Tribe has questioned is whether Cruz's own originalist judicial theories -- expressed when the senator was a student in his Harvard Law class, and again on the campaign trail when speaking about potential judicial nominations -- would render himself eligible for the White House.\"Ironically, the kind of justices he says he wants are the ones that say he's not eligible to run for president,\" Tribe argued on CNN this week. \"This is important because the way this guy plays fast and loose with the Constitution, he's a fair-weather originalist.\"In a Boston Globe editorial, Tribe argued that almost any judge would avoid weighing in on Cruz's eligibility.\"No real court is likely to keep Cruz off the ballot, much less remove him from the White House if he were to win -- Bush v. Gore isn't likely to get a return engagement over this issue,\" he wrote.But soon after the debate concluded, Tribe went further, telling CNN's Anderson Cooper that the issue is a \"serious cloud\" over Cruz and saying he can see a challenge going to the Supreme Court.\"If some secretary of state refuses to put his name on the ballot if he's the nominee, there's no way out of it other than to have Cruz or the Republican National Committee sue the secretary of state. And that issue would then have to go all the way to the Supreme Court,\" Tribe said. \"But the fact is, you know, it's a serious cloud. It has to be taken seriously. It's not just a matter of coming up with great talking points or winning some debate. I think he does a disservice to the Constitution and the country when he thinks he can slide his way, slip slide his way around this serious constitutional issue,\" Tribe said.Verdict: True (Editor's note: We changed the verdict from false because Tribe's comments after the debate suggested a legal fight was much more likely.)Ted CruzReality Check: Cruz on the U.S. sending $100 billion to IranBy Eve Bower and Sonam Vashi, CNNSen. Ted Cruz of Texas said, \"President Obama is preparing to send $100 billion or more to the Ayatollah Khomeini. I will tell you, it was heart-breaking ...\"We previously fact-checked this when Donald Trump made a similar claim in the December 15 debate. Here's what we found: In 2011 and 2012, the United States and Europe imposed sanctions on Iran that included freezing some Iranian assets overseas. With the announcement of a deal in 2015, those same assets stand to be released, creating a pool of money that will be newly available to the Iranian government. The total amount of those assets is not known, but as a deal with Iran seemed imminent, some estimated that the number was as high as $150 billion.In late July, at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the deal, House Speaker John Boehner, just as Cruz said, claimed that \"more than $100 billion\" in unfrozen assets would be available to Iran.Both the Treasury Department and the White House have disputed these estimates.JUST WATCHEDTed Cruz deflects NYT 'hit piece'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTed Cruz deflects NYT 'hit piece' 01:20In Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew's July testimony to the Senate, he estimated that, after sanctions relief, Iran will only be able to access \"about $50 billion\" in unfrozen assets. He noted that another large portion -- about $20 billion -- was tied up in projects with China, and \"tens of billions\" comprise nonperforming loans to Iranian energy and banking interests.The money already belongs to Iran but has been frozen, so the United States is not sending this money from its coffers to the Iranian government. Additionally, none of the parties with access to the assets have substantiated an estimate close to the figure that Cruz suggested.Verdict: FalseReality Check: Cruz on percentage of Americans workingBy Tami Luhby, CNNMoneyAsked whether America's economy is as strong as President Barack Obama said in his State of the Union address, Sen. Ted Cruz said, \"We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977.\"Last month, 59.5% of Americans age 16 and older were employed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That's higher than it was in 1977, when it ranged from 57% to 58.7%.The share of Americans employed during Obama's terms has ranged from as low as 58.2% in mid-2011 to as high as 60.6% when Obama took office in January 2009.Since 1977, the highest share of Americans were employed in April 2000, when 64.7% had a job.However, the overall percentage of adults who are working isn't the best measure, since the number of retirees is growing as the nation ages. So let's look at the share of prime working age adults (age 25 to 54) who are employed. Some 77.4% of these Americans were employed in December, compared to between 71% and 72.8% in 1977.By no measure is the share of Americans employed at its lowest point since 1977.Verdict: FalseOpinion: Who won the Trump-Cruz smackdown?Reality Check: Cruz on Dianne Feinstein taking away all gunsBy Lisa Rose, CNNDuring a discussion of proposed reforms to gun laws in the wake of recent mass shootings, Cruz claimed, \"California senator, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein said if she could say to Mr. America and Mrs. America give me your guns, I'm rounding them up, she would.\"Feinstein did say something to that effect -- 21 years ago. And she was referring specifically to assault rifles, not all firearms.Cruz exhumed the comment from a 1995 episode of \"60 Minutes,\" during which Feinstein discussed the limitations of the assault weapons ban. She talked about loopholes in the law that allowed dealers to sell assault rifles weapons at gun shows.\"If I could have gotten 51 votes in the Senate of the United States for an outright ban, picking up every one of them, 'Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in,' I would have done it,\" Feinstein said. \"I could not do that. The votes weren't here.\"Because Feinstein's comments were only about assault weapons and made 21 years ago, not as part of Obama's current initiative, we rate his claim true, but misleading.Reality Check: Cruz on Manhattan's conservativesBy Kevin Liptak, CNNCruz, explaining his attack on Donald Trump's \"New York values,\" asserted there are \"not a lot of conservatives coming out of Manhattan.\"JUST WATCHEDCruz, Trump debate 'New York values'ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHCruz, Trump debate 'New York values' 01:37There's no doubt New York City's third-most-populous borough is known more for liberal urbanites than as a bastion of conservatism. But the island is not without its Republicans.Voter registration records indicate there are 83,970 active Republicans on the rolls in Manhattan -- only about 10% of the total number registered, but not an insignificant portion.Some of those Republicans carry outsized influence on the national political stage. The latest federal campaign finance filings show Manhattan donors contributed $2.9 million to Republican presidential candidates, the second-highest concentration of donations in the country behind Houston.Cruz himself has taken in $135,588 from Manhattan's ZIP codes this cycle, behind his rivals Jeb Bush and Chris Christie, but still more than many other Republicans in the race. While those numbers are far behind the campaign cash taken in by Democrats in Manhattan, the borough clearly remains a magnet for politicians of all stripes looking to raise funds.The federal filings also don't account for contributions to outside groups like super PACs, which raise enormous amounts of money from wealthy Manhattan donors. One of the most prolific conservative political donors, David Koch, is a resident of Park Avenue.Cruz's claim that \"not a lot of conservatives\" come out of Manhattan is, based on pure voter registration numbers, true. But the influence of the Republicans that do reside there extends well beyond the East and Hudson rivers.Verdict: Mostly trueCarly FiorinaReality Check: Fiorina on vetting visa applicants' social media accountsBy Kate Grise, CNNDuring the Fox Business Network undercard debate, Carly Fiorina claimed that \"this (Obama) administration has told us they don't even bother to check Facebook or Twitter to find out who's pledging allegiance to jihadists. We can do better than this, citizens. We need to take our country back.\"On December 16, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said that the department has, in fact, been examining social media when reviewing visa applications since early 2015. \"Under my leadership as secretary, we, in fact, began to consult social media in connection with conferring various immigration benefits and we will be doing more of this,\" he added. \"Any reports or partial reports to the contrary are simply false.\"JUST WATCHEDFiorina slams Trump, ClintonReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFiorina slams Trump, Clinton 01:16Johnson did acknowledge that there were some restrictions on looking at an applicant's social media account before 2015, but said that there was no current policy prohibiting the check of an applicant's social media.\"We had policies in place regarding consulting social media, which in my judgment, particularly in this current environment, were too restrictive,\" Johnson said.Many have criticized immigration officials for not checking the social media accounts of Tashfeen Malik, one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters, after there were reports that she advocated jihad in messages on social media. Her comments were made under a pseudonym and with strict privacy settings that did not allow people outside a small group of friends to see them, U.S. law enforcement officials told CNN.FBI Director James Comey said that neither Malik or her husband and fellow shooter posted publicly on social media about supporting jihad.However, they did show \"signs in their communication of their joint commitment to jihad and to martyrdom\" in private messages, according to Comey. The comments were private communications, both by phone and social media, and the U.S. government was not monitoring them because they had no reason to. The couple were not on any terrorist watch lists, and Malik made her comments under a fake name behind many privacy settings that would have required a warrant to access them. Even if immigration officials had looked at Malik's social media accounts, they would not have had access to her private communications.JUST WATCHEDFiorina: We can't outsource leadership in Middle EastReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHFiorina: We can't outsource leadership in Middle East 01:13A U.S. official told CNN that the United States only recently began routinely reviewing the social media activity of visa applications from certain countries. The exact date that these types of reviews began is not clear, but it was after Malik's application was considered, the source said.While the policy changed only a year ago, Fiorina's claim that immigration officials don't bother looking at visa applicant's social media has been untrue for more a year.Verdict: FalseReality Check: Fiorina on record numbers of men out of workBy Tami Luhby and Sonam Vashi, CNN\"We have record numbers of men out of work, we have record numbers of women living in poverty, we have young people who no longer believe that that the American Dream applies to them,\" Fiorina said.Related: Why have so many men stopped working?There were 42.1 million men who were not working in December, just below the record 42.9 million set in October 2013, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This includes men who were not in the labor force, as well as those who are unemployed. (To be included in the labor force, you have to be working or actively looking for a job.)While Fiorina's comment is true, it is misleading because the vast majority of men who are not in the labor force are not looking for work. They include students, retirees and those who've just given up trying to find a job.That said, there is an employment crisis among working-age men these days. The labor force participation rate -- which includes those who are working or have looked for a job in the past four weeks -- is near record lows. The share of men ages 25 to 54 in the labor force now hovers near a record low of 88%. It stood at nearly 97% in 1965.Verdict: True, but misleadingReality Check: Fiorina on Geneva ConventionsBy Jamie Crawford and Ryan Browne, CNN Regarding Iran's brief detention of U.S. Navy sailors, Fiorina said, \"The President wouldn't even mention the fact that Iran had taken two Navy boats and our sailors -- hostage. He didn't mention the fact that they violated the Geneva Conventions.\"The Geneva Conventions are a series of treaties and rules that apply in times of armed conflict and also seek to protect people who are not or are no longer taking part in hostilities.In a briefing with reporters on Thursday, State Department spokesman John Kirby said, \"The Geneva Conventions apply for wartime; we're not at war with Iran. So, it's a moot question.\"Legal experts with whom CNN spoke tend to agree with that assertion. \"We don't have a state of declared war or actual armed conflict between the U.S. and Iran, therefore the application of the Geneva Conventions does not come into play,\" Allen Weiner, the director of Stanford's Program in International and Comparative Law, told CNN. \"Both sides have said it was an inadvertent crossing into territorial waters, where Iran is entitled to exercise criminal jurisdiction,\" Weiner added.Steven Vladeck, a professor at American University School of Law in Washington and a CNN contributor, told CNN that \"Common Article 2 of Geneva is clear on this,\" and only applies in a state of war or armed conflict.\"There is a whole lot of daylight between animosity and armed conflict,\" Vladeck said, adding other legal mechanisms applying to international human rights law or governing the law of the sea, but the absence of direct armed conflict between the two countries negates the application of the Geneva Conventions in this case.But legal experts said there are relevant legal provisions that Iran could be in violation of based on what occurred.Some experts CNN spoke to did indicate that the Iranian actions may have violated customary maritime law. In a situation where a ship enters territory waters due to a technical problem or damage, a country \"would have the right to verify the problem\" but not use force to detain the sailors, according to Craig Allen, a professor of marine and environmental affairs at the University of Washington. Verdict: FalseRick SantorumReality Check: Santorum on Americans without college degreesBy Lisa Rose, CNNRick Santorum said that President Barack Obama's policies have hurt the manufacturing sector, creating dwindling employment opportunities for the \"74% of Americans who don't have a college degree between the age of 25 and 65.\"The former senator, a Penn State alum who once called the President a snob for promoting higher education, needs to check his numbers again.JUST WATCHEDRick Santorum: Go Google meReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRick Santorum: Go Google me 01:00According to 2014 census data, the most recent stats available, 67% of Americans between 25 and 64 have not graduated from college. The total number of people in that age bracket is 164.8 million, and 55.2 million of them have not attained a bachelor's degree or higher.Santorum made a similar statement in May on \"Face the Nation,\" although he blamed both parties for failing to address economic inequality among the \"70% of Americans who don't have a college degree.\" Politifact checked his claim and rated it true, crunching Census numbers to conclude that 68% of Americans 25 and older don't have degrees, good enough for a green light from the website.Santorum wasn't a math major at Penn State so he can be forgiven for the miscalculation, but he should have stuck with his original estimate.

Ted Cruz had their most public and direct fight of the campaign.The real estate developer effectively planted the idea in voters' minds that Cruz's Canadian birthplace could be a liability should Democrats challenge the Texas senator's eligibility to run for president.Trump also steamrolled Cruz over the latter's attack on his \"New York values.\"\"When the World Trade Center came down, I saw something that no place on Earth could have handled more beautifully, more humanely than New York,\" Trump said to applause.Opinion: Who won the Trump-Cruz smackdown?Ted CruzBuilding on his recent surge in the polls, Cruz elevated himself as he went toe to toe with The Donald -- indicating a two-man race might be in the offing.Cruz got the most screen time in two separate bouts with the billionaire.The Texas senator sought to dismiss Trump's questions about his \"natural-born\" status as ridiculous by introducing questions about Trump's own eligibility given the billionaire's Scottish-born mother. And he pointed out that he, a lawyer who's argued constitutional cases before the Supreme Court, would not be taking any legal advice from Trump, who has no legal training.And then he added some levity when he suggested Trump could be his VP, and jump to the head of the ticket if he is ruled ineligible.Despite Trump's strong defense of his New York background, Cruz's references to issues such as abortion, guns and gay marriage could win him support from conservatives in Iowa.\"I think most people know exactly what New York values are,\" Cruz said.READ: Trump-Cruz 'bromance' is overChris ChristieChristie delivered the strongest debate performance of the establishment candidates as he touted his record as a governor and let his no-nonsense New Jersey spirit shine.A one-liner against Rubio is sure to get some play.\"You already had your chance, Marco.

Sorely missing. John KasichJohn Kasich was also present last night -- and that sums up his performance.The New York TimesThe Republican candidates took several swipes at a favorite conservative punching bag -- The New York Times -- and tried to turn recent negative reports to their advantage.\"If that's the best hit the New York Times has got, they better go back to the well,\" Cruz said in dismissing an article raising questions about his adherence to campaign finance regulations.\"It's the New York Times. They're always wrong,\" Trump stated in rejecting a piece that said he called for a 45% tariff on China.MehMarco RubioThe senator from Florida started off strong with a slap-down of Hillary Clinton that also served to one-up his former mentor, Jeb Bush, and delivered a strong finish when he slammed Cruz as a flip-flopper. In fact, his attack was so cutting that it almost elevated him into the list of winners. But despite his strong moments, Rubio was mostly out of view amidst the Trump and Cruz back-and forths.He popped in with a zinger at one point, disparaging the Trump-Cruz feud as an \"episode of Court TV\" but did little more to seize the spotlight.Unlike in past debates, Rubio didn't stand out -- and he let Christie get the better of him in some key spots -- a major lost opportunity as the two duel in the first-in-the-nation primary state of New Hampshire.JUST WATCHEDRubio to Cruz: We all saw you flip your voteReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRubio to Cruz: We all saw you flip your vote 02:00 Jeb BushThe former Florida governor was clear and concise in his delivery -- something that escaped Bush in the campaign's early debates -- but his adult-in-the-room persona often seemed starkly at odds with the direction of the primary conversation.In response to Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from the U.S., Bush insisted, \"This policy is a policy that makes it impossible to build the coalition necessary to hit ISIS.\"Trump pushed back with a simple, straight-to-the-heart message that seemed to resonate with the audience: \"I want security for this country.

Kerry mentioned a potential new total as high as 100,000, as well as other possible maximum numbers, according to the aide.In all, about 1,500 Syrian refugees have been admitted to the United States since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, the vast majority of them this fiscal year.Here's a breakdown: 23 in 2011, 41 in 2012, 45 in 2013, 249 in 2014 and 1,199 so far this fiscal year, which ends September 30, according to the State Department figures as of September 4.About 300 more refugees are expected to be admitted by the end of this fiscal year. This equates to a grand total of about 1,800 refugees from Syria's four-year civil war being admitted to the United States by October 1, according to U.S. officials.Human rights groups have called on the U.S. to accept 65,000 Syrian refugees by the end of next year. Last spring, Democratic lawmakers wrote to Obama asking him to \"significantly increase\" the number of Syrians permitted to resettle in the U.S.Kerry and Assistant Secretary for Population, Refugees and Migration Ann Richard told lawmakers that they could come back to seek congressional agreement, or an \"emergency exception\" to bring in more refugees, a source familiar with the meeting said. A congressional aide said Kerry suggested he could return to Congress to ask for their support for admitting as many as 30,000 more refugees.\"We are looking hard at the number that we can specifically manage with respect to the crisis in Syria and Europe,\" he said after the meeting. \"That's being vetted fully right now.\"A senior State Department official briefing reporters said there were \"varying views among lawmakers present at the meeting about accepting more refugees.\" The official said Kerry proposed \"a range of different numbers.\"\"The thinking all along this year was we could move to increase it, some sort of a modest increase,\" the official said. \"Given what's going on in the world today, I know that there's a lot of people outside the administration, and inside the administration, too, in very senior positions, who would like to increase it significantly.\"Syrian refugees: Which countries welcome them, which ones don'tThe official added: \"The question becomes, will Congress support that? Can we move this process that we have, that doesn't turn on a dime, to start bringing larger numbers sooner? That's hard.\"The official added the main objective of the resettlement program was to ensure refuges admitted to the United States return home once the conflict ends, which was difficult to do when they were resettled so far from home.In a statement after the meeting, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, expressed his concerns.While he said Kerry was seeking a \"reasonable increase\" in refugees allowed into the U.S. for the coming year, referring to the 5,000 figure, he added that \"when pressed, the administration indicated that they were considering opening the floodgates and using emergency authority to go above what they proposed to Congress in today's consultation.\"He continued, \"Before agreeing to accept tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, the Obama administration must prove to the American people that it will take the necessary precautions to ensure that national security is a top priority, especially at a time when ruthless terrorist groups like ISIS are committed to finding ways to enter the United States and harm Americans.\"Vetting the Syrian refugees has been a problem. The U.S. relies on U.N. lists of refugees who are deemed safe candidates for resettlement, but the screening process can take between 18 and 24 months and strains the resources of the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Immigration Services.Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said Wednesday that the current migration is a \"disaster of biblical proportions\" that poses an opportunity for terrorist groups such as ISIS to \"infiltrate operatives among these refugees.\"\"What we're trying to do is weed out people who are liars, who are criminals or would-be terrorists,\" a senior State Department official said.JUST WATCHEDRefugee gives birth, carries newborn on 11-day walkReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHRefugee gives birth, carries newborn on 11-day walk 02:17\"I believe that the President has made it clear he wants the United States -- which has always taken a leadership role with respect to humanitarian issues and particularly refugees -- to be able to do what we can,\" Kerry told reporters after his meeting with senators Wednesday.\"We are committed to increasing the number of refugees we take and we are looking hard at the number we can specifically manage with respect to the crisis in Syria and Europe and their migration today,\" Kerry said.Kerry's meeting is part of an annual discussion the administration has with Congress to set its refugee admissions quota for the next fiscal year.But while the meeting is routine, it comes at a time when unprecedented international attention is being paid to the issue of refugee resettlement.More than half the population of Syria has been displaced by the ongoing civil war, and the flow of refugees in the Middle East and Europe has put a strain on countries' resources and divided local populations.The United States has accepted just over 1,500 refugees from the crisis so far, the vast majority of them in the past year.The rate of admissions is growing, but the U.S. is limited in how quickly it can resettle refugees because of both admissions quotas and security concerns.On Tuesday, State Department spokesman John Kirby said the administration's response to the crisis would need to be balanced against \"the proper vetting procedures to make sure that, particularly when we're bringing in people from that part of the world, that we're doing it safely and securely.\"Congressional Republicans in particular have raised alarm bells for months over the possibility that Syrian extremists -- including ISIS sympathizers -- could enter country by pretending to be refugees, potentially committing attacks against the homeland.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated information about Rep.

That organization provides support services, such as language and vocational training, as well as monetary assistance for housing and other necessities.What's the security vetting process like?Much attention has been focused on the security vetting refugees must go through before they come to the United States, particularly after it was revealed that one of the terrorists in the Paris attacks entered Europe through a refugee processing center.Several federal agencies, including the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department, the National Counterterrorism Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are involved in the process, which Deputy State Department Spokesman Mark Toner recently called, \"the most stringent security process for anyone entering the United States.\"READ: Donald Trump: Syrian refugees a 'Trojan horse'These agencies use biographical and biometric information about applicants to conduct a background check and make sure applicants really are who they say they are.The applicant is interviewed by a DHS officer with training in this screening process as well as specialized training for Syrian and Iraqi refugee cases.And refugees from Syria actually go through another layer of screening, called the Syria Enhanced Review process.\"With the Syrian program, we've benefited from our years of experience in vetting Iraqi refugee applicants,\" a senior administration official recently told reporters. \"And so the partnerships we have today and the security checks we have today really are more robust because of the experience that we've had since the beginning of large-scale Iraqi processing in 2007.\"Another senior administration official noted that the refugee screening process is constantly refined.What are the challenges associated with vetting these refugees?Given the abysmal security situation in Syria and the fact that the United States does not maintain a permanent diplomatic presence in the country, it's sometimes difficult for U.S. authorities to gather the information they need to thoroughly vet a Syrian applicant.FBI Director James Comey hit on the issue at a congressional hearing last month, when he told lawmakers, \"If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them.\"This particularly comes into play when trying to evaluate an applicant's criminal history.\"In terms of criminal history, we do the best we can with the resources that we have,\" one senior administration official said.Another official emphasized that the vetting process is a holistic one, and they try to take a broader view of an applicant with the available information they're about to aggregate and verify. READ: Ben Carson asks congress to block Syrian refugeesHow many refugees have been admitted to the United States?U.S. government data shows that just under 2,200 Syrian refugees have been admitted into the United States since the civil war broke out in March of 2011, and the vast majority of those were in the last year.The administration has acknowledged that processing resettlement applications is a slow and laborious task, which has kept the United States from accepting as many applicants as it would like to.But the pace of admissions is growing as the United States commits more resources to the endeavor.What do we know about the refugees admitted so far?According to senior administration officials, more than half of the Syrian refugees admitted into the U.S. so far are children.\"Single men of combat age\" represent only 2% of those admitted and the elderly comprise another 2.5%. The male/female breakdown is \"roughly\" 50/50.The approval rate for Syrian refugees so far is a little over 50%, although the official noted that those not included in this pool include both rejected cases and pending cases, so the approval rate is expected to go up.Where are these refugees?The Syrian refugees who have been admitted into the United States so far are spread out over 36 states in 138 cities and towns.California has accepted the most Syrian refugees (252), followed by Texas (242) and Michigan (207).Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have not admitted any refugees, but that doesn't necessarily reflect a lack of will. Resettlement locations are determined based on a number of factors, including family ties, the size of the local immigrant community and the ability of local resettlement agencies to accommodate new cases.Officials also take into account the unemployment rate of the area to ensure refugees are able to find work and begin supporting themselves.READ: Chris Christie on refugees: Not even 5-year-old orphansHow many will be admitted in the future?As the Syrian refugee crisis in Europe and the Middle East became more dire over the summer, the Obama administration decided to re-evaluate how many Syrian refugees could be admitted.Ultimately, the President decided to set a goal of 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which goes until October 2016.In order to accommodate these additional Syrian refugees, the administration upped the total number of refugees it would allow in FY2016 to 85,000, with plans to increase it to 100,000 in FY2017.But there are significant challenges associated with increasing the quota.As noted above, the vetting process for Syrian refugees is intensive and plagued by gaps in information.In order to meet the 10,000 quota it has set, the administration will have to admit five and a half times more Syrian refugees in the coming year than it admitted in the previous 4\u00bd years combined.READ: Ted Cruz: Muslim refugees from Syria should go to other Islamic countriesWho decides the quota?The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 sets fairly clear guidelines for how the government can set and change refugee admissions quotas.Per section 207, the President has the authority to set the annual number, following \"appropriate consultation\" with members of Congress.This is done at the start of the fiscal year but can be revisited midyear in cases where \"an unforeseen emergency refugee situation exists\" and the admission of refugees in response to that emergency \"is justified by grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.\"In that situation, the President can amend the number of refugees allowed prior to the start of the next fiscal year, again in consultation with Congress, essentially briefing the lawmakers.READ: Paris attacks become focus of 2016 raceMy governor wants to stop admitting Syria refugees. Is that allowed?Over half of U.S. governors, most of them Republicans, announced in the aftermath of the Paris attacks that their states would not accept any further refugees from Syria. But it's unclear whether they have the legal authority to do this.\"This is a federal program carried out under the authority of federal law,\" one senior administration official noted, \"and refugees arriving in the U.S. are protected by the Constitution and federal law.\"Refugees are required to adjust their status to become legal permanent residents of the United States within one year of their arrival, at which point they are free to move anywhere in the country, although the official noted some specific benefits may only be available in the state where they were originally resettled.But experts tell CNN that while the states may not have the legal authority to block their borders, state agencies have authority to make the process of accepting refugees much more difficult by cutting state and local funding. \"I think the entire program is contingent on the support of the American people,\" the official acknowledged. \"It is contingent, as all programs in the United States government are, on funding from Congress.\"Now lawmakers are weighing in with proposals to block Syrian refugee funding entirely, which would have the effect of freezing their absorption. This step presents its own challenges, since funding for Syrian refugees is allocated along with funds to support refugees from other countries.Follow @CNNpolitics Sign up for CNN Politics' Nightcap newsletter, serving up today's best and tomorrow's essentials in politics.", "article_highlights": "The average processing time for refugee applications is about 12 to 18 months, but Syrian applications can take longer U.S. government data shows that just under 2,200 Syrian refugees have been admitted into the U.S. since the civil war broke out", "article_author": "Laura Koran"}

Christie to be United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey.\" Christie was officially confirmed by the U.S. Senate on December 20 and sworn into office on January 17, 2002, more than four months after 9/11.VERDICT: FalseFact check: Jeb Bush says Florida's school voucher program was created during his governorship.The voucher program was originally part of Bush's education reform plan, which was created in 1999. Florida became the first state in the nation with a statewide voucher program.It allowed students in some of the worst schools to get vouchers of up to $3,389 to attend private and parochial schools. But the Florida Supreme Court struck it down in 2006. In 2001, Bush signed into law a tax-credit scholarship program, which has grown into the largest single school-choice program of any state.VERDICT: TrueFact check: Ben Carson says there have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.When asked to comment about Donald Trump linking childhood vaccines to autism, Ben Carson, a pediatric neurosurgeon by training, said \"there have been numerous studies and they have not demonstrated that there is any correlation between vaccinations and autism.\" He said the claim was spread over the past two decades thanks to a now-discredited study, published in 1998, that linked the measles, mumps and reubella vaccine to autism. Dr. Andrew Wakefield was the lead researcher of the study, published in the British medical journal The Lancet. After learning that Wakefield was compensated for his research by a law firm hoping to sue the makers of the vaccine, most of the co-authors of the paper withdrew their names.Drs. @RealBenCarson and @RandPaul discuss vaccines with @realDonaldTrump http://t.co/jcEf6bW9ja #CNNDebate #GOPdebate http://t.co/usGOrqNJ1v\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 17, 2015In 2010, Wakefield lost his medical license, and in 2011, the journal retracted the study. Subsequent studies looking for a link between the vaccine and autism haven't found any.In February, in the midst of a measles outbreak, the autism advocacy organization Autism Speaks issued a statement stating, \"over the last two decades, extensive research has asked whether there is any link between childhood vaccinations and autism. The results of this research are clear: vaccines do not cause autism. We urge that all children be fully vaccinated.\"VERDICT: TrueRELATED: #CNNDebate: Post-game buzzFact check: Christie says he supported medical marijuana.\"In New Jersey we have medical marijuana laws, which I have supported and implemented,\" Christie said. \"This is not medical marijuana, this goes a much further step beyond. This is recreational use of marijuana. This is much different. And so while he (Rand Paul) would like to use the sympathetic story to back up his point it doesn't work. I am not against medical marijuana. We do it in New Jersey. But I am against the recreational use of marijuana.\" Christie did support a modest expansion of the state's medical marijuana program in 2013, but that was after he fought the implementation of the program signed by his Democratic predecessor, Jon Corzine. And, one year after he signed the medical marijuana expansion, he criticized medical marijuana as a \"front for legalization.\"RELATED: Christie seeks changes in New Jersey medical marijuana billChristie did allow an expansion of the medical marijuana program created by his predecessor, but he never mentioned the times he fought medical marijuana in his debate answer.VERDICT: True, but misleadingFact check: Donald Trump says Wisconsin is losing $2.2 billion.In November 2014, the Wisconsin Department of Administration said state agencies' budget requests would exceed expected revenues by $2.2 billion dollars for the 2015-2017 budget cycle.However, Wisconsin is required by state law to balance its budget. Therefore, state lawmakers cut spending, including slashing funding for the University of Wisconsin by $250 million. The budget that Gov. Scott Walker signed in July did not have a deficit.VERDICT: FalseFact check: Sen. Ted Cruz's criticism of the Iran nuclear agreement.\"There are several facilities in Iran they designate as military facilities that are off-limit altogether,\" the Texas senator said. \"Beyond that, the other facilities, we give them 24 days' notice before inspecting them. That is designed to allow them to hide the evidence and most astonishingly, this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves.\"The Additional Protocol, which Iran signed onto under the nuclear agreement, allows the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. nuclear watchdog agency, to seek access to any site, including military sites.Specific access is determined by a parallel agreement between Iran and the IAEA, often referred to by the deal's detractors as \"secret side deals.\"The 24-day window Cruz referred to comes into play if Iran and the IAEA are not able to agree on access to a particular site.From the time IAEA requests access to that site, they and Iran have 14 days to either arrange access or find another way to address the IAEA's concerns to that group's satisfaction. If its concerns aren't met, the P5+1 members (which consists of the U.S., Russia, China, France, the UK and Germany) have a week to determine a way to address it, and Iran has three days to comply with their order.The notion of self-inspections first arose when details of a draft of the so-called \"side deal\" between Iran and the IAEA were reported in the media.They revealed that Iran would participate in monitoring and inspecting the Parchin military facility, which the West suspects that Iran has used for military nuclear work.U.S. officials say that while Iranians would have a role in inspecting the site, inspectors from other countries will participate as well and the IAEA would be monitoring the process throughout. The leader of the IAEA said the suggestion of self-inspections \"misrepresent the way in which we will undertake this important verification work.\"But neither the United States nor the IAEA have made the agreement public, citing precedent in keeping IAEA pacts confidential.Cruz's assertion falsely suggests that all nuclear inspections in Iran would be conducted by the Iranians, but without access to the full document, it's unclear exactly how inspections at Parchin will proceed. And the assertion that military facilities are entirely off-limits is also false.VERDICT: False in regard to self-inspections, but It's Complicated on the 24-day noticeFact check: Florida Sen. Marco Rubio claims \"The (legal immigration system) primarily is built whether you have a relative living here instead of merit.\" Approximately two-thirds of the people who were admitted to the United States from 2000 to 2013 as lawful permanent residents were admitted on the basis of family ties, according to a November 2014 report from the U.S. Congressional Research Service. In 2013, the most recent year for which we have aggregate data, of the 990,553 foreign nationals who were admitted to the United States as lawful permanent residents, 649,763 were admitted on the basis of family ties. .@marcorubio: \"We have a legal immigration system that no longer works\" http://t.co/jcEf6bW9ja #CNNDebate #GOPDebate http://t.co/9GrahISPZ8\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 17, 2015If employment offers or specific professional achievement qualifies as \"merit,\" then 161,110 immigrants became lawful permanent residents under this category in 2013, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The percentage of this category, called \"employment-based preferences\" constituted 16.3% of the total number of immigrants who became lawful permanent residents in 2013. Verdict: TrueFact check: Rubio says America is the \"most generous\" nation on immigration.Rubio said that America is the most generous country on immigration.\"Despite the fact that we have the most generous country in the history of the world in allowing people to come here legally, we have people still coming illegally,\" Rubio said.The Department of Homeland Security's data shows that just over 1 million immigrants moved here legally in 2012. That number dropped a bit to 990,553 in 2013, but these numbers still make the United States the highest in sheer number of immigrants accepted. Germany is the next largest acceptor of immigrants, with almost 966,000 in 2012. When you look at the number of immigrants compared to the population, however, the U.S. does not look as generous. According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, the United States ranks 19th with these immigrants, making up about 0.33% of the total population.VERDICT: True, but misleadingFact check: Bush says U.S. has failed to bolster ties to any nation under Obama.President Barack Obama has reopened ties with at least two countries that the U.S. had no diplomatic relations with when he entered office.\"What I know to be true is that the next president of the United States is going to have to fix an extraordinary difficult situation,\" Bush said. \"This administration, with President Obama and Hillary Clinton, has created insecurity the likes of which we never would've imagined. There's not a place in the world where we're better off today than six and a half years ago.\"In 2012, the Obama administration renewed full diplomatic ties with Myanmar, which had been an international pariah for more than two decades over the crackdown of its military government on the pro-democracy movement. Obama has visited the country twice as president.This year, Obama renewed relations with Cuba, meeting the country's leader, Raul Castro, at a summit in Panama and officially reopening the U.S. embassy in Havana last month.While many Republicans fiercely oppose the renewal of ties to Myanmar and Cuba, it's clear the official U.S. relationship with those countries is better than when Obama took office, since there was virtually no relationship beforehand.America's diplomatic ties to other countries, including Israel, have been strained under Obama, as Obama has acknowledged in some cases. But it's not accurate to suggest that all U.S. relationships abroad have suffered under Obama.VERDICT: FalseFact check: Carly Fiorina says a Planned Parenthood video shows a \"fully formed fetus on the table, with its heart beating, its legs kicking.\"Carly Fiorina said, \"Anyone who has watched this video tape -- I dare Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, to watch these tapes. Watch a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart beating, its legs kicking, while someone says we have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.\"Fiorina was referring to a video released by the anti-abortion group The Center for Medical Progress last month, in which a former worker for StemExpress, a biomedical research company, said she saw a fully formed fetus's heart beating. .@CarlyFiorina dares @POTUS and @HillaryClinton to watch the #PlannedParenthood videos http://t.co/jcEf6bW9ja http://t.co/uuxke0FHcd\u2014 CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) September 17, 2015\"This is the most gestated fetus and closest thing to a baby I've ever seen,\" Holly O'Donnell, a former procurement technician for StemExpress, said in the video. \"I'm sitting here looking at this fetus and its heart is beating and I don't know what to do.\"Carly Fiorina distinguishes herself on debate stage The clip does show what appears to be a fully formed fetus on an operating table with its legs twitching. But the clip Fiorina references is not part of the CMP sting video but was instead taken by another anti-abortion group and was added to the sting video. The Center for Medical Progress, however, doesn't explain where the fetus video was shot, so it's not clear whether it was taken at a Planned Parenthood clinic. For its part, the women's health organization has flatly denied the accusations.VERDICT: True, but misleadingFact check: Chris Christie says he repeatedly defunded Planned Parenthood in New Jersey.New Jersey Gov.

Trump hosted a high-dollar fundraiser for Bush in 1998, shortly before he won office, and gave $50,000 to the Florida Republican Party. But upon taking office, Bush stuck to his stance against gambling and Trump's proposed casino never materialized.VERDICT: FalseFact check: Trump says he never went bankrupt.There have been two comments so far about Trump and bankruptcy: At the prime-time debate, the mogul said he never went bankrupt, hours after former New York Gov. George Pataki said in the earlier debate that every one of Trump's Atlantic City casinos went bust.Trump himself has never filed for personal bankruptcy. But he has filed four business bankruptcies -- Trump Taj Mahal, 1991; Trump Castle Associates, 1992; Trump Hotel & Casino Resort, 2004; and Trump Entertainment Resorts, 2009 -- which Bankruptcy.com says makes Trump the top filer in recent decades. All of them were centered around casinos he used to own in Atlantic City. They were all Chapter 11 restructurings, which lets a company stay in business while shedding debt it owes to banks, employees and suppliers.RELATED: Everything you want to know about Donald Trump's bankruptciesTrump claims that successful businesses file for bankruptcy all the time. At the August debate, he said, \"Virtually every person that you read about on the front page of the business sections, they've used the (bankruptcy) law.\"But the facts don't back up that comment. Fewer than 20% of public companies with assets of $1 billion or more have filed for bankruptcy in the last 30 years, according to data from Bankruptcy.com and S&P Capital IQ.VERDICT: True but misleadingFact check: Lindsey Graham says we need legal immigrant workers in order to replenish the workforce, based on historical ratios of workers to retirees.\"In 1950, there were 16 workers for every retiree. How many are there today? There are three,\" Graham said in the first debate. \"In 20 years, there is going to be two, and you're going to have 80 million Baby Boomers like me retiring en masse, wanting a Social Security check and their Medicare bills paid. We're going to need more legal immigration. Let's make it logical. Let's pick people from all over the world on our terms, not just somebody from Mexico. Let's create a rational, legal immigration system because we have a declining workforce.\"According to Social Security data, in 1950, there were 16.5 covered workers per Social Security beneficiary. In 2014, the latest figures available, there are 2.8, which is lower than Graham's figure. Twenty-five years from now, in 2040, the projection is 2.1. VERDICT: TrueFact check: Bobby Jindal says letting more Syrian refugees into the U.S. would involve a circumvention of the normal immigrant vetting process.\"The answer to this is not to put a Band-Aid on this and allow even more people to come into America,\" Jindal said at the first debate. \"We should not short-circuit the vetting process -- we've got a normal vetting process. Simply allowing more people into our country doesn't solve this problem,\" Jindal said.Actually, the increase the Obama administration is proposing would be managed through the normal process within the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.JUST WATCHEDBobby Jindal: Obama to blame for refugee crisisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHBobby Jindal: Obama to blame for refugee crisis 01:05RELATED: U.S. to take at least 10,000 more Syrian refugeesThe 10,000 refugees the administration plans to admit in fiscal year 2016 will follow this multi-step process, which involved registering with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, then undergoing a physical exam, interview and interagency security vetting.Once they've completed this process, the refugees will be referred to approved sponsor agencies in the U.S. that will facilitate their integration into American life.The president of the United States, in consultation with Congress, sets the quota for how many refugees can be admitted through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program at the beginning of each fiscal year, and can change that number mid-year if there is a humanitarian refugee crisis.VERDICT: FalseFollow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "The team rated the claims either: True; Mostly True; True, but Misleading; False; or It's Complicated.The team compared candidate statements against research and reporting", "article_author": "Tom LoBianco, Theodore Schleifer, Laura Koran, Kevin Liptak, Debra Goldschmidt, Amy Roberts, Eve Bower, Mary Davies and Tami Luhby, CNN"}

But Bush's exchanges have included questions from reporters at many of his events, while Clinton has \u2014 by the most generous count \u2014 taken a total of 13 questions since entering the race, and hasn't sat for any interviews. Take Chipotle: Clinton was discovered on a closed-circuit security feed in one of the restaurants only after she'd been there. Bush talked with reporters in New Hampshire about the local franchise in Miami, and how he really likes to cook up his own Mexican food at home. Still, Bush has insisted that he's not yet actually a candidate \u2014 that he's still in an exploratory phase. And neither Bush nor Clinton have detailed the policy underpinnings of their campaigns.Bush appeared unprepared this week to answer one of the most obvious questions his candidacy would face: With the benefit of hindsight, was the Iraq war a mistake? He was confronted Wednesday in a town hall meeting in Nevada by a voter who didn't care for Bush's insistence that questions such as those are hypothetical and therefore shouldn't be answered. The Reno man's point: The entire exercise of running for president is answering one big hypothetical question. In Tempe, Arizona on Thursday, Bush had had enough. \"Knowing what we now know, I would not have engaged \u2014 I would not have gone into Iraq,\" he said. 21 photos: Jeb Bush's lifeFormer Florida Gov.

Former George W. Bush White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said the Bush family legacy is \"something that will follow [Jeb Bush] throughout his campaign\" \u2014 but that the Iraq war issue, while a \"difficult phase,\" won't cause long-term damage. \"It was your classic stumble,\" Fleischer said. \"Every candidate will have one or two. The good candidates only have one or two. The candidates who get into trouble have many.\" The Democratic National Committee unsurprisingly took a much harsher view, saying Bush's inability to separate himself from his brother on such an obvious issue was a game-changer.\"We got a long, hard look at what a Jeb foreign policy would look like, and here's the real shocker: It would look a lot like his brother's,\" said Arizona Democratic Party chair Alexis Tameron. WATCH: The Bush family and IraqThe most pressing issue Clinton faces \u2014 free trade \u2014 is a bigger problem than Bush's, Fleischer said, because Clinton's unwillingness to stake out a firm position on the Trans-Pacific Partnership and related legislation recall her 2008 campaign, in which Clinton appeared most interested in avoiding controversy. Today, Obama is pushing Democrats to adopt his position in support of the trade deal, while Clinton hasn't commented on the pact publicly beyond tepid statements since entering the race.\"This is your classic tale of a politician who isn't strong enough to take a strong stand. That can dog you,\" Fleischer said. \"That's why I think an issue like this, which is less sensational, can be more damaging,\" he said. \"Because it's about a governing mindset, and her governing mindset is to find whichever position is most convenient in whatever time she's in.\" For Clinton, her refusal to answer questions has left pressure building, making her every utterance more combustible. That much was evident when it was Bill Clinton, during a visit to Africa, who was answering questions about his wife's presidential campaign platform, while the former secretary of state kept a quiet public schedule this week. Clinton did privately address trade in a private meeting with donors Thursday in Brooklyn. Former Sen. Evan Bayh offered the details afterward, telling a small group of reporters that Clinton \"gave the answer you're familiar with: She said 'look I want to see what the proposed agreement is before expressing an opinion on it. We need to reap the benefits and at the same time ... help the people who would be adversely affected.'\" Democrats who support Clinton doubt that her handling of the press matters much at this stage with the election more than a year and a half away, and most voters not tuned in. They offer an alternative view: Clinton's refusal to wade into the fight of the moment shows that she's learned from 2008 and is now much more able to stay focused on the messages most important to her. Bayh said Clinton is in fact running a campaign that better mirrors her this time. \"There's something in some ways about being unsuccessful that can be liberating,\" the former Indiana governor and senator said. \"She didn't have to run. She's focused on the fact that it's really not about her, it's about where the country needs to go. And that is a liberating perspective.\"50 photos: Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlightFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pictured here on Tuesday, March 3, has become one of the most powerful people in Washington.

And whether the invasion was a mistake has become a central focus of the current and prospective presidential field after Jeb Bush ran into controversy by appearing to unconditionally back his brother's decision to authorize it. Bush drew criticism from both sides of the aisle, and has given multiple interviews backtracking and clarifying his initial comments, saying Wednesday that \"of course anybody would have made different decisions\" given what's known now.But Rubio's comments appeared to mark a shift on the issue from just months prior, in March, when he defended the Iraq War on Fox News.RELATED: Iraq haunts Jeb Bush in 2016Asked if it was a mistake to go to war with Iraq on Fox News' \"The Five,\" Rubio said, \"No, I don't believe it was. The world is a better place because Saddam Hussein doesn't run Iraq.\"He made similar comments in a 2010 interview on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" When asked if \"America safer and better off for having gone to war in Iraq,\" Rubio said, \"I think the answer ultimately is yes.\"\"First of all, the world is better off because Saddam Hussein is no longer in charge in Iraq,\" he said at the time.Asked to clarify whether Rubio had changed his mind on the war, a spokesman said there was no discrepancy between his past and current statements on the issue. He said that though Rubio said Wednesday he wouldn't have approved the invasion knowing about the faulty intelligence, the senator wasn't ultimately calling the war a \"mistake.\"\"Bush did not make a mistake when he ordered invasion given intelligence and Saddam's actions,\" Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said in an email.20 photos: Moments from Marco Rubio's careerFlorida Sen.

George W. Bush,\" he said. \"Yes, I mean, so just for the news flash to the world, if they're trying to find places where there's big space between me and my brother, this might not be one of those.\"In the same interview, Bush said he thinks he can sell the Republican base on his position on immigration -- and he's hitting opponents who have changed their positions on the issue.\"I get a sense that a lot of people can be persuaded, to be honest with you,\" the former Florida governor told Megyn Kelly in a preview of his interview that aired Sunday.Bush has urged a respectful tone toward undocumented immigrants and has said it should be easier for those immigrants to gain legal status.That position is anathema to much of the party's conservative base, which opposes \"amnesty\" in any form -- particularly the executive actions President Barack Obama has taken to allow immigrants who were brought into the United States as children to stay, as well as the undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children. Bush said he would repeal Obama's unilateral actions.But the former Florida governor took a shot at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, though not by name, for changing his position on immigration. Walker once supported a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, but has said he's changed his views -- and even recently called for limits on legal immigration.\"Do you want people to just bend with the wind, to mirror people's sentiment, whoever's in front of you?\" Bush said. \"'Oh yes, I used to be for that, but now I'm for this' -- is that the way we want to elect presidents?\"Bush's perspective differs from much of the GOP field: He lives in Miami, has a Mexican-born wife and has said his family speaks Spanish at home. His brother, former President George W. Bush, previously supported immigration reform efforts.Another Florida Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio, also supported efforts to ease immigrants' ability to attain legal status -- though he's since backed off that position as Republicans have grown increasingly critical of Obama's handling of the issue.As Republicans shift to the right, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has run as far to the left as possible, saying undocumented immigrants should be allowed to become U.S. citizens and that she'd try to go further than Obama in using her executive authority to aid immigrants.Though a politically challenging position for Bush in his likely GOP primary campaign, a moderate immigration position would serve him well in a general election campaign as Hispanic voters are the most rapidly growing voting bloc.Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Eric Bradner, CNN"}

But the Christian population, he believes, has nowhere else to go, and Cruz batted away concerns by telling reporters in Myrtle Beach on Sunday that Christians posed \"no meaningful risk\" to national security.That has made him vulnerable to charges of discrimination, both from liberal activists and the White House.Cruz plans to introduce legislation in the Senate this week to cut off federal funding for refugee resettlement, allying himself with Ben Carson, perhaps Cruz's closest competitor in the presidential race. And he also said he supports governors who are closing their borders to the refugees.\"I was one of the very first to stake out this position.

Bush administration but being equally as critical of those who posit that America should abandon targeted military campaigns. For instance, Cruz does not support American intervention in Syria, instead calling for an offensive air operation and to arm the Kurds in the region. Cruz's position on the \"religious test\" drew the scorn of President Barack Obama on Monday, which called out Cruz by name at a press conference and said his position was \"not American.\"\"It's not surprising that President Obama is attacking me personally,\" Cruz said. \"I'll tell you what is shameful is that we have a President that after 7 years still refuses to utter the words radical Islamic terrorism.\"Obama's attack could be a political boon for a candidate energized by sparring with the White House from the pole position in the conservative movement. Cruz wouldn't quite go as far as his other conservative rival, Donald Trump, who suggested that some mosques should be closed, but Cruz's rhetoric on Monday is his latest try to race to the right on every issue in the GOP primary.What to do with the Syrian refugees is proving to be politically volatile. Just two hours after sitting down with Bash, Cruz met protestors at an event who heckled him loudly as he worked the crowd: \"We don't want a president who discriminates against Muslims!\" three young college students shouted at Cruz repeatedly for over 10 minutes. \"You can't let only Christians into the U.S.\"\"It's not Muslims, it's terrorists,\" one Cruz supporter volleyed back. \"Then go over to them and join them,\" yelled another.Cruz, for his part, didn't seem rattled.\"I think it says something that speaking at a college campus, on the entire campus, only two protesters come out and yell,\" Cruz told CNN as he left the event. \"I'll take those numbers any day.\"", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Theodore Schleifer, CNN"}

And at retail stops and town halls across the northern part of the state this week, Iowans repeatedly asked concerned questions about Cruz's position, with Cruz and allies seeking to soothe worries that Cruz would promote the oil fields of the state where he lives over the corn fields of the state that he needs.Cruz, who won ideological admirers when he attended a high-profile agricultural summit in March and refused to endorse the RFS in front of an unfriendly crowd, has not shied away from his unpopular stance. But in recent days, he has tried to finesse the complicated politics, and at least try to avoid angering voters.Julie French, who runs a farm with her husband, asked Cruz on Wednesday in Cherokee to defend his position, and wasn't immediately pleased with his answer.\"Are you planning to jerk the rug out from underneath us? Or are you going to let it expire in 2022?\" she asked him, calling for input from Cruz's Iowa endorser and subsidy champion, Rep. Steve King. \"Ethanol does not get any subsidies. Steve King, you know that,\" she said.\"The lobbyists are trying the best they can to snooker the people of Iowa,\" Cruz told French. \"I don't want Iowa dependent on Washington. I don't think Iowa farmer want to be dependent on Washington.\"As a way of appealing to Iowans, Cruz has tried to shift attention away from the RFS, the highest-profile policy difference between Cruz and the local industry, toward his plans to roll back Environmental Protection Agency regulations on certain ethanol blends and to vigorously pursue antitrust cases to open up new markets.And for a brief moment on Wednesday, Cruz received some encouraging news. Americans for a Renewable Future, the nonprofit, pro-ethanol subsidy group which only on Monday had pledged to \"expose Cruz's anti-job, anti-farmer crusade,\" told reporters that his recent moves had eased some of their concerns. Cruz had told a crowd in Sioux Center on Monday evening that he would support phasing out the RFS not immediately, but by 2022, according to the group.\"While not perfect, this is a big step forward by Sen. Cruz,\" the group's president, Eric Branstad -- the popular Republican governor's son -- said in a statement.The group said it wouldn't stop following him around the campaign trail or reminding reporters that he wasn't as strong on the issue as his GOP rivals, though.But just a few hours later, Cruz took umbrage at the idea that he had shifted his position at all.\"I recognize that there was an attack press release that was put out by a bunch of lobbyists and Democrats attacking me,\" Cruz told reporters in Spencer on Wednesday evening. \"And I know this is a shocking position for you that a group of lobbyists and Democrats who me say something that is not true.\"Aides said Wednesday that Cruz has always supported a five-year sunset for the RFS, pointing to a comprehensive energy bill Cruz introduced in the Senate.But the dust-up offered fresh fodder for other candidates who have labored to portray Cruz as less than consistent.\"Another day, another flip-flop from Sen. Ted Cruz,\" said Joe Pounder, a spokesman for rival GOP candidate Marco Rubio. \"Only a few months ago, Sen. Cruz used his opposition to the Renewable Fuel Standard calling for it to be phased out before 2022 as a prime example of him not being a career politician. Today, he changed his position.\"Kerby Todd, who stood to question Cruz about his position in an Iowa hotel lobby, perhaps showed best the struggle even Cruz's own supporters must put to rest.\"I agree with your point about a free market,\" he told Cruz. \"But I don't agree with the point that we should change the fundamentals that this industry was built on.\"", "article_highlights": "Ted Cruz is attempting the politically risky tactic of changing Iowans' minds on ethanolCruz is turning the issue to focus on his push to break from the Washington Cartel", "article_author": "Theodore Schleifer, CNN"}

Rand Paul, another 2016 contender, introduced legislation that would block the United States from issuing visas to refugees from countries with a high risk of terrorism in an effort to \"stop terrorists from walking in our front door.\"Paul Ryan's strategy on Syrian refugeesRyan said Monday he has asked the Obama administration to provide a classified briefing for all House members on the situation in Paris. On Tuesday FBI Director James Comey and DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson will deliver a classified briefing to lawmakers, at 5:30 p.m. in the Capitol Visitors Center auditorium. Senators will be briefed on Wednesday.An aide to the GOP leader said it's not clear when that will take place but it doesn't appear it will be Monday.In a radio interview with Bill Bennett, Ryan also said he has tasked all committees of jurisdiction to come up with recommendations about how to ensure the thousands of Syrian refugees the President wants to settle in the United States won't be involved in terrorism. Ryan said he was particularly concerned since at least one of the attackers in Paris is believed to have been part of the waves of refugees into Europe from Syria.\"Look, we've always been a generous nation taking in refugees. But this is a unique situation. This is a situation where you have single men coming over, which is not women and children,\" Ryan said.

Classified briefings are also in the works for senators but have not been finalized.Texas Sen. Ted Cruz made a similar case in South Carolina, saying that \"anyone with an ounce of common sense would say 'no, we shouldn't be bringing in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees.'\" \"Instead,\" Cruz said, \"we should be resettling them humanely in Middle Eastern countries that are majority Muslim. We can help them deal with their refugee status, but the first obligation of the President needs to be as commander in chief to protect the safety of the United States of America.\"As he introduced his legislation, Paul said he wants enhanced screening measures for refugees. \"The Boston Marathon bombers were refugees, and numerous refugees from Iraq, including some living in my hometown, have attempted to commit terrorist attacks. The terrorist attacks in Paris underscore this concern that I have been working to address for the past several years,\" he said. Obama responds from TurkeyObama pushed back against the Republican presidential field Monday and seemed to take particular exception to the sentiments of Cruz -- though not by name.\"When I hear folks say that maybe we should just admit the Christians and not the Muslims (refugees), when I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which person who's fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted -- when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution -- that's shameful. That's not American,\" Obama said, whose plans currently call for 10,000 Syrians to be admitted over the coming year.Both Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's parents fled Cuba, though only Cruz has mentioned a religious test. Rubio told ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" this weekend that the U.S. shouldn't accept any refugees from Syria. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union\" that the United States should focus on assisting Christians in Syria.RELATED: CIA director anticipates more ISIS attacks 'in the pipeline'The United States has accepted 2,178 Syrian refugees since the civil war began there in March 2011 -- and that number is expected to grow dramatically in the current fiscal year. The refugees have been admitted to 138 cities and towns in a total of 36 states -- with California, Texas, Michigan, Arizona and Illinois taking the most, according to wrapsnet.org, where the U.S. government keeps its official numbers.Louisiana has seen 14 Syrian refugees located there. Ohio has 76 relocated Syrians, while New Jersey, led by 2016 GOP contender Chris Christie, has 88.The 14 states that have admitted no refugees are Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont and Wyoming, as well as the District of Columbia. Administration sticking with plansThe Obama administration wasn't backing off its plans to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in 2016. State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday the government is \"steadfastly committed\" to that plan. He said federal officials are taking \"seriously\" the states' concerns, and that he's not sure whether they have the legal authority to block the resettlements. One Democratic presidential contender -- former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley -- backed Obama's plans. \"Scapegoating an entire religious community and rejecting those fleeing ISIL's terrorism and persecution is what the terrorists want,\" O'Malley said in a statement. \"We need to step up and act like Americans, in accordance with our principles,\" he said. \"There are women and children dying and fleeing the same sort of carnage that was unleashed on the people of France. This is a time for American leadership, not a time for us to cower.\" Two top-ranking Democratic senators backed Obama, too. Ben Cardin of Maryland, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said the United States has a more stringent vetting process for refugees. \"All the refugees that come to America come from the United Nations refugees' centers and have been gone through by multiple agencies in the United States on background and vetting. It's a totally different circumstance,\" he said. And Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey said that \"we can't stop the idea that we can expect the world to take refugees and we can walk away from it. We should do all of our vetting to make sure and that is why the flow is going to be very slow.\"Congress could block funding for refugeesSeveral influential Republican House and Senate leaders are pushing, too, to block Syrian refugee resettlement. Sen. Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican and influential chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said the refugee program \"should be suspended until the American people are satisfied that they know exactly who the president is admitting into the country via this program.\"Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, offered several specific proposals in a letter to top-ranking Senate budget writers, saying that Congress should \"require, as a condition for any funding for refugee resettlement for Syrian refugees, a comprehensive plan on how security will be achieved,\" included prior vetting by U.S. intelligence officials.Grassley continued: \"Not one dollar should be expended until stringent parameters for vetting these refugees are established.\"House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, took a more direct shot at Obama in previewing a Thursday subcommittee hearing on the Syrian refugee crisis. \"When will President Obama take ISIS threats seriously, as well as the warnings of national security officials within his own administration, and cease his plan to bring thousands of Syrian refugees into the United States?\" Goodlatte said in a statement. \"His disconnectedness to reality is needlessly jeopardizing national security and Americans' lives.\"Governors move to keep refugees outJindal has already signed a state executive order barring the resettlement of Syrian refugees there. He ordered the state's government to use \"all lawful means\" to block those refugees from entering Louisiana and authorized the state police to monitor any who are already there. Jindal's executive order says that \"it is foreseeable that the introduction of Syrian refugees into the United States without proper prior screening and follow-up monitoring could result in a threat to the citizens and property of this state.\" GOP governors who aren't involved in the presidential race are moving to bar Syrian refugees from their states, too. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted that \"Texas will not accept any Syrian refugees & I demand the U.S. act similarly. Security comes first.\" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted that he \"will oppose Syrian refugees being relocated to Arkansas.\"Indiana Gov. Mike Pence similarly ordered his state to suspend the resettlement of Syrian refugees, \"pending assurances from the federal government that proper security measures have been achieved.\"The Republican governors of Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Wisconsin similarly moved to stop Syrian refugees from coming into their states.Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad hasn't attempted to stop accepting Syrian refugees, but a spokesman said that \"the governor is requesting that the federal government, who has the authority under the Constitution to decide these matters, be open and transparent with any refugee resettlements.\"Democratic governors in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Pennsylvania, Washington and Vermont said they'd continue accepting Syrian refugees, too. New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan is the only Democrat to oppose Syrian refugees' resettlement in the United States -- a stance that's particularly notable since she is challenging Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte in 2016. A spokesman said Hassan \"believes that the federal government should halt acceptance of refugees from Syria.\" Follow @CNNpolitics Sign up for CNN Politics' Nightcap newsletter, serving up today's best and tomorrow's essentials in politics.", "article_highlights": "Republican presidential contenders pushed for an end to U.S. resettlement of Syrian refugeesThe rhetoric on the right has clearly angered Obama, who said Monday that the U.S. must remain committed to its values of tolerance and accepting immigrants", "article_author": "Eric Bradner and Ted Barrett, CNN"}

The era of arm-chair quarterbacking our military will end in my administration.\" But Carson did rebuke the notion of only allowing in Christian refugees.\"Well, of course we don't apply religious tests, but we should apply ideological tests, and I would be very reticent to bring in people who are ideologically opposed to the ideal of America,\" Carson said.As for those refugees who are already here, of which there are more than 2,000, he said the U.S. should put them under surveillance.\"I would watch them very carefully, that's for sure.

But he also had no answer to a question about how NATO powers should invoke the Article 5 provision calling for mutual defense after the attack on NATO ally France, taking a long pause before saying: \"I'm not sure.\"\"They have declared war on us,\" he said. \"Article 5 says if you do something that is seen as an attack on any member of NATO, everybody obviously joins him, but the reason that I'm a little hesitant is because I'm not 100% sure that just saying I vote Article 5 will change anything, I think it's really more what we do than what we say that is important,\" Carson said. Pressed for specifics on how he would fight ISIS differently than this administration, Carson actually praised the recent U.S.-supported operation to free Sinjar and cut off a key ISIS supply route, and said he would use \"every resource available\" in the fight including the world banking system. He also said the U.S. cannot try to avoid all casualties in the war. \"You cannot fight a politically correct war,\" Carson said. \"There will be collateral damage, and if you're intention is to try to find a way not to have any collateral damage, you're not going to be very effective.\"Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "Carson told reporters that he has sent a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan asking to move a bill that \"terminates all ongoing funding\" for Syrian refugee resettlement Carson also spent much of the news conference trying to demonstrate his bona fides as commander in chief", "article_author": "Tal Kopan, CNN"}

This is about national security,\" Ryan said, and called on all members of the House to address the situation quickly.House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters on his way into a classified briefing that the House will vote on Thursday on a bill requiring a beefed up vetting system. The bill would suspend the U.S. program allowing refugees from Syria to enter the country until the Secretary of the Homeland Security Department certifies that those wanting to resettle in the U.S. do not pose a security threat.\"This is just a start,\" McCarthy said, noting members wanted \u200eto vote on something before the Thanksgiving recess.Drafted by North Carolina Republican Rep. Richard Hudson, the proposal also requires that the FBI certify that those applying to enter the U.S. have had background checks.More than half the nation's governors say Syrian refugees not welcome So far one House Democrat, Rep. Brad Ashford, has signed on as a supporter of Hudson's bill, and GOP aides expect the measure to have broader bipartisan support.In the Senate, several Democrats defended the program assessing Syrian refugees as painstaking and rigorous and pointed to as evidence the low number of Syrian refuges allowed into the country over the last four years. They also said many of the vetted refugees were rejected. But they also said lawmakers and the public need more information on exactly the program works before they can assess if changes are needed.Obama administration officials, who briefed House members Tuesday, are scheduled to brief senators on the intricacies of the vetting program in a closed session Wednesday afternoon. \"I don't think at this stage we should be pausing until we get all the facts,\" said Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid.

Scott Walker, though not by name, for changing his position on immigration. Walker once supported a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, but has said he's changed his views -- and even recently called for limits on legal immigration. \"Do you want people to just bend with the wind, to mirror people's sentiment, whoever's in front of you?\" Bush said. \"'Oh yes, I used to be for that, but now I'm for this' -- is that the way we want to elect presidents?\" Bush's perspective differs from much of the GOP field: He lives in Miami, has a Mexican-born wife and has said his family speaks Spanish at home. His brother, former President George W. Bush, previously supported immigration reform efforts. Another Florida Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio, also supported efforts to ease immigrants' ability to attain legal status -- though he's since backed off that position as Republicans have grown increasingly critical of Obama's handling of the issue. As Republicans shift to the right, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has run as far to the left as possible, saying undocumented immigrants should be allowed to become U.S. citizens and that she'd try to go further than Obama in using her executive authority to aid immigrants.Though a politically challenging position for Bush in his likely GOP primary campaign, a moderate immigration position would serve him well in a general election campaign as Hispanic voters are the most rapidly growing voting bloc.Bush also defended his education record, saying his support for Common Core is based on a need for higher educational standards -- but those should be state-driven, with no influence from the federal government, he said. He also acknowledged critiques of specific questions on Common Core-related standardized tests. \"Common Core means a lot of things to different people, so they could be right based on what's in front of them,\" Bush said. Bush also said he would have done the same as his brother in deciding to go to war in Iraq if he had been president at the time.His comments come in the wake of Bush's private statement that he relies on his brother, former President George W. Bush, as an adviser on some Middle East affairs. \"I would have [authorized the invasion], and so would have Hillary Clinton, just to remind everybody. And so would almost everybody that was confronted with the intelligence they got,\" Bush said in the interview.Clinton's 2003 vote in support of a resolution to green-light the war in Iraq was a key part of the 2008 campaign, with then-Sen. Barack Obama hammering her hawkish stance. It could help Bush blur lines between the two when it comes to his brother's legacy.Bush said the United States should have focused more on security in Iraq, but said his brother agrees on that point. \"By the way, guess who thinks that those mistakes took place as well? George W. Bush,\" he said. \"Yes, I mean, so just for the news flash to the world, if they're trying to find places where there's big space between me and my brother, this might not be one of those.\"Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Eric Bradner, CNN"}

Ohio and Iowa, meanwhile, have become reliable swing states that have wavered back and forth over the years. Now with Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio, and Michigan having Republicans as governors -- all of whom were re-elected last year -- some are turning their eye to the Rust Belt as a potentially fruitful target for Republicans in 2016, especially as other swing states like Virginia and Colorado tend to become reliably more blue.Walker sought to paint himself as a Republican coalition builder, saying he garnered support from a wide swath of Republicans in his state -- from the Chamber of Commerce to the tea party and \"everyone in between,\" he said. But, in an attempt to bolster his electability credentials in a general election, he also pointed out that he won a majority of independents in his re-election bid last year.JUST WATCHEDWalker highlights contrast with BushReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHWalker highlights contrast with Bush 01:55As he typically has done when he's visited Iowa, Walker talked about his roots in the state, dating back to when he lived in Plainfield as a kid in the 1970s. He referenced going to Happy Chef when he was younger, a breakfast chain that can be found throughout the Midwest. And he told a story about his grandparent's tire coming off their car in Dubuque, located on the state's eastern border. Walker did not mention his tendency to shop at Kohl's, a department store chain that's become a crowd favorite during his speeches on the trail. He uses the retailer, which is headquartered in Wisconsin, to illustrate his frugalness as well as his ideal tax policy. In the same way that Kohl's makes a profit by lowering the prices of items and expanding the volume, he'd like to see lower tax rates across the board with an expanded number of people paying taxes. It's already a concept called the \"Laffer Curve,\" but Walker says he's renamed it the \"Kohl's Curve.\"However, Bloomberg Business published a report earlier this week detailing how Walker's administration helped obtain multimillion-dollar tax incentives for the store, which was considering moving its headquarters out of state in 2012. When asked by the Des Moines Register this week if he should disclose the tax credits whenever he talks about Kohl's, Walker asked, \"Why?\"\"You're talking about thousands of jobs,\" Walker continued. \"It's not unlike what we do with the (tax break) package the state has available for any number of employers out there. The dollar amount is only bigger because instead of a hundred jobs, you're talking about thousands and thousands of jobs.\"19 photos: Potential 2016 presidential candidatesFormer Florida Gov.

His tone also contrasted with that of French President Francois Hollande, who was speaking at the same time in France.\"France is at war,\" Hollande declared, indicating he would ask parliament to impose a three-month-long state of emergency. Obama, for his part, justified his use of the term \"contained\" last week to describe the ISIS threat, a remark he made in an interview that aired just hours before the Paris terror attack. \"When I said that we are containing their spread in Iraq and Syria, in fact they control less territory then they did last year and the more we shrink that territory, the less they can pretend that they are somehow a functioning state,\" Obama said Monday. \"And the more it becomes apparent that they are simply a network of killers who are brutalizing local populations that allows us to reduce the flow of foreign fighters, which then over time will lessen the numbers of terrorist who can potential carry out terrible acts like they did in Paris.\" He was also dismissive of those who \"seem to think that if I were just more bellicose in expressing what we're doing, that would make a difference.\"Instead, he said, \"We'll do what is required to keep the American people safe.\"He continued, \"if folks want to pop off and have opinions about what they think they would do, present a specific plan. If they think that somehow their advisers are better than my chairman of my Joint Chiefs of Staff and the folks who are actually on the ground, I want to meet them. \"He cited U.S. efforts to help Kurds retake Sinjar Mountain in Iraq and the recent killing of an ISIS leader in Libya as examples of his strategy working.\"ISIL leaders will not have a safe-haven anywhere,\" he said, calling the terror group the \"face of evil.\"In regards to preventing the Paris attack, Obama said his intelligence agencies gave no specific mentions of this particular attack that would have indicated something that the U.S. could have provided French authorities.\"I'm not aware of anything that is specific that would have given premonition of action in Paris,\" he said.But Obama did announce that the United States would begin a new \"streamlined\" process of sharing intelligence with France. He said the agreement will allow intelligence personnel to \"pass threat information, including on ISIL, to our French partners more quickly and more often\" and could help prevent further attacks.The fruits of that cooperation were borne Sunday night, when French jets began a bombardment of Raqqa, the Syrian headquarters of ISIS. A senior administration official said the U.S. was assisting the operation.But the mission reflected only an incremental surge of existing strategy, which has focused on using air power to take out ISIS sites in Iraq and Syria. White House officials ruled out sending combat ground troops into Syria, and made no indication it was rethinking a no-fly-zones.Obama was speaking just before departing from the G20 summit, being held at a Turkish resort 500 miles from the Syrian border. The economic conference was already slated to focus intently on combating ISIS before the Paris attacks; after the mass violence in France, talks between Obama and other leaders revolved primarily on the terror crisis.He huddled for 30 minutes with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday, agreeing during the informal meeting on a path toward a political transition in Syria. He also spoke with the king of Saudi Arabia and European leaders to consolidate support for his plan against ISIS.But there appeared to be little appetite among foreign leaders here for a large-scale ground effort in Syria.The Paris attacks have dashed whatever momentum Obama had been enjoying in his battle against ISIS, including helping Kurdish fighters retake Sinjar Mountain in Iraq and apparently killing the ISIS executioner \"Jihadi John\" in a drone strike.They've also brought new scrutiny to the flood of refugees from Syria, which Obama has said must prompt new measures by European nations to accommodate those fleeing their country's civil war.One of the suspected culprits of the Paris terror attack is thought to have entered Europe in the current wave of migrants, leading some leaders to demand tighter controls on the flow. The U.S. has accepted only 1,500 refugees from Syria since 2011, but the White House said in September that 10,000 would be allowed entry next year.Obama condemned critics who want a \"religious test\" for admitting refugees from Syria, blasting the idea as un-American. He also used the charge to indirectly attack Republican 2016 presidential candidates.\"When I hear political leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for which a person who is fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted, when some of those folks themselves come from families who benefited from protection when they were fleeing political persecution, that's shameful, that's not American,\" Obama said. \"That's not who we are. We don't have religious tests (for) our compassion.\"Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who are both running for president, are the children of Cuban immigrants and have called for increased scrutiny of refugees fleeing Syria who seek asylum in the U.S. Obama called on world leaders to accept refugees fleeing the conflicts in Syria and Iraq, though he added that accepting refugees required \"rigorous screening and security checks.\"\"We also have to remember that many of these refugees are victims of terrorism themselves,\" Obama said.\"The overwhelming majority of victims of terrorism ... are Muslims,\" Obama added later. \"ISIL does not represent Islam, it is not representative in any way of the attitudes of the overwhelming majority of Muslims.\" Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "President Barack Obama defended his strategy for fighting ISIS in a press conference MondayObama also stood by comments he made Friday saying ISIS had been containedObama also slammed Republican critics who have called for increased scrutiny -- if not outright banning of allowing refugees to enter parts of the U.S.", "article_author": "Kevin Liptak, Kristen Holmes and Tal Kopan, CNN"}

Bush for saying explicitly after the Sept. 11 attacks that we are not at war with Islam itself. \"The notion that some of those who have taken on leadership in his party would ignore all that, that's not who we are. On this, they should follow his example, it was the right one. The right impulse. Our better impulse,\" Obama said. \"The values that we're fighting against ISIL for is precisely that we don't discriminate against people because of their faith, that we don't kill people different than us,\" Obama said. \"It is good to remember that the United States does not have a religious test.\"JUST WATCHEDDavid Frum on refugee crisis after ISIS attacks in ParisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHDavid Frum on refugee crisis after ISIS attacks in Paris 05:03Obama went so far as to say promoting the notion that the terror attacks in Paris are the core views of Islam could lead to \"greater recruitment\" for the terrorist group.It was not the only time during his speech and answers that he was clearly going after the Republicans running to replace him.In the remarks defending his strategy against ISIS, Obama repeatedly said that the only suggestion from his critics that the U.S. isn't already pursuing is committing more troops to the Middle East, and he said that the best military minds in the U.S. believe that would be a losing strategy.

It was one of the seminal moments of a presidency that has lurched from crisis to crisis, as under political siege, and before the eyes of the world, Obama stood alone on stage and made a case for a policy to combat a virulent new threat that few politicians and experts outside his administration believe is working.'As is typical of his polarized political era, Obama offered plenty to gratify his backers and to infuriate his critics.An Obama supporter would have seen an intellectual statesman dispassionately dispensing common sense policy and acting according to history's timetable rather than with knee-jerk action or tough-guy rhetoric tailored to the modern media environment.And as he talked about visiting troops maimed on his watch, Obama hinted at the soul-searing decision a commander in chief must make and the limits of U.S. power in the post-Iraq age.But those who see him as weak and lacking the public fortitude sometimes required of an American president would also have had their belief confirmed that Obama is stubbornly refusing to acknowledge that the world is in the grip of a new global terrorist insurgency that requires bolder action.JUST WATCHEDLandmarks turn blue, white and red in support for ParisReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHLandmarks turn blue, white and red in support for Paris 01:12And opponents who believe that Obama undermines the possibility for the use of limited but potentially effective force by painting all military action as equaling vast infantry deployments will also have seen little to ease their frustration.Obama did describe ISIS as the \"face of evil\" and said that the \"barbaric terrorist organization\" needed to be destroyed. And he noted that flags were flying at half staff back home in recognition of the agony in France, America's oldest ally.But his appearance could hardly be described as a rallying call for Western nations wondering who is next on the ISIS hit list. For a president who made his name with soaring rhetoric, his news conference was noticeably short on Churchillian statements of resolve or promises that the civilized world would triumph over this mortal danger.READ: Why did Obama declare ISIS 'contained' the day before Paris attacks?That's partly owing to the president's personal style -- he has always been loath to indulge in what he sees as empty made-for-the-moment political gestures -- even though other U.S. commanders in chief have seen such behavior as a vital part of the presidency's theatrical tool kit.But there's also a creeping frustration evident in the President these days. With his hair now snowy and his patience brittle in the twilight of his presidency, Obama's reserve of ideas to tackle a new threat seemed to be running dry.And he betrayed exasperation, lashing out at political enemies back home even from his elevated perch on the world stage. He was visibly irked by reporters' questions that all basically boiled down to: \"Mr. President, are your policies a disaster?\"The press conference, part of a global tour by Obama that now takes him to Southeast Asia, comes at a time when the President's vehement refusal to embrace new U.S. entanglements in the Middle East is facing its most grueling test, from ISIS's burgeoning threat abroad to the shifting politics of the war on terror back home.But Obama, who in 2009 inherited a nation weary of war and who brought most troops in Iraq and Afghanistan home, declaringthat the \"tide of war is receding,\" is adamant he won't change tack now despite a wave of criticism.Republican criticismHis 2012 election rival, Mitt Romney, on Monday warned that if Obama did not change course, the United States could be hit next. Another critic, GOP presidential candidate and South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, predicted that \"there's a 9/11\" coming and joined with another vanquished Obama foe, Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, to demand a troop surge into Syria to drive ISIS out of the civil-war torn nation.Even front-running Democrat Hillary Clinton, who is hugging Obama close on the campaign trail, implicitly rebuked her old boss on Saturday by saying that more must be done to beat ISIS.But Obama -- who once called ISIS a \"JV\" team and last week insisted it had been contained -- on Monday rejected perceptions that his approach was failing, given the recent attacks in Paris, Beirut, Iraq and on a Russian airliner all claimed by ISIS.\"We have a comprehensive strategy, using all the elements of our power: military, intelligence, economic, development and the strength of our communities,\" he said in Antalya.The White House, meanwhile, points to recent victories on the ground in Syria attributed to Kurdish troops backed by U.S. air power as proof that the operation is chipping away at ISIS's self-declared caliphate spreading across Syria and Iraq.READ: How terror in France could shape an election in AmericaIn remarks that may appear to some in France as offhand, Obama argued that, \"the terrible events in Paris were obviously a terrible and sickening setback.\"But he added: \"Even as we grieve with our French friends, however, we can't lose sight that there has been progress being made.\"To Obama's critics, who believe ISIS has morphed from a regional threat into a ravenous extremist group now spreading its tentacles through Libya, Egypt, Pakistan, Afghanistan and elsewhere and which is pulling off mass-casualty attacks on Western cities, such remarks are nothing short of delusional.His attitude appeared to contrast with the hawkish rhetoric of Francois Hollande, who on Monday made a rare address by a French president to a joint session of parliament, telling the body that France is now at war.\"He sees the world as he likes to see it, as fantasy,\" said Republican Presidential candidate Chris Christie over the weekend, joining a rising chorus of GOP candidates seeking to use the growth of ISIS for a political lift.Nonpartisan observers also see a gulf between Obama's position and the widening reality of ISIS as a global threat. After all, the group has now carved out a training ground in Iraq and Syria far larger than that enjoyed by al Qaeda in Afghanistan before the September 11, 2001, attacks.A strategy under seige\"Clearly, the strategy is not working because of the terrible terrorism we have seen in Paris, in Beirut, in Ankara,\" said CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank.\"Sure, they have shrunk the territory they control a little bit in Syria and Iraq. But this is a group now using those countries, a huge safe haven there, as a platform for International terrorism,\" he said, calculating that they were \"the richest terrorist group in history, tens of millions if not more in the bank\" with up to 6,000 European recruits coming in.\"I don't think this was the speech people in Paris today wanted to hear,\" he said.Still, the White House has long argued that a key lesson from the bloody U.S. occupation of Iraq is that American armies -- even those with hundreds of thousands of troops -- cannot hold together a Middle East region that is splintering apart.The President has often told aides privately that the situation in Syria is so dire that no sudden policy change could make a tangible difference -- and the White House indignantly points out that U.S. planes have flown thousands of sorties over Syria and Iraq to combat ISIS.But despite his ambivalence, Obama seemed to relish a chance in Turkey to lay into political rivals critical of his strategy, uttering some of his most impassioned lines in an implicit rebuke that they would find things a lot tougher from behind the Oval Office desk. 31 photos: Aftermath of Paris terror attacks31 photos: Aftermath of Paris terror attacksA memorial commemorates the victims of the Paris attacks on a street in Paris on Monday, November 16.Hide Caption 1 of 3131 photos: Aftermath of Paris terror attacksA woman on November 16 sits in front of the Parisian concert venue Balaclan, where many of the victims from the Paris attacks were killed.

Jeb Bush, who is fighting for a foothold in a Republican primary process in which hawkish rhetoric sells, think so.Bush told Fox News on Monday that for all his effort to avoid entanglements in the Middle East, Obama was actually driving America into a \"quagmire\" because he lacked a strategy to eliminate ISIS.It was a taste of the kind of politics that might hike pressure on the President for a change of course in the coming months if public criticism of his policy intensifies. So, despite his resolve to stick with his current ISIS strategy on Monday, the President elected to end wars may spend his final year in office fighting to head off another U.S. incursion into the Middle East.

That organization provides support services, such as language and vocational training, as well as monetary assistance for housing and other necessities.What's the security vetting process like?Much attention has been focused on the security vetting refugees must go through before they come to the United States, particularly after it was revealed that one of the terrorists in the Paris attacks entered Europe through a refugee processing center.Several federal agencies, including the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Defense Department, the National Counterterrorism Center and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are involved in the process, which Deputy State Department Spokesman Mark Toner recently called, \"the most stringent security process for anyone entering the United States.\"READ: Donald Trump: Syrian refugees a 'Trojan horse'These agencies use biographical and biometric information about applicants to conduct a background check and make sure applicants really are who they say they are.The applicant is interviewed by a DHS officer with training in this screening process as well as specialized training for Syrian and Iraqi refugee cases.And refugees from Syria actually go through another layer of screening, called the Syria Enhanced Review process.\"With the Syrian program, we've benefited from our years of experience in vetting Iraqi refugee applicants,\" a senior administration official recently told reporters. \"And so the partnerships we have today and the security checks we have today really are more robust because of the experience that we've had since the beginning of large-scale Iraqi processing in 2007.\"Another senior administration official noted that the refugee screening process is constantly refined.What are the challenges associated with vetting these refugees?Given the abysmal security situation in Syria and the fact that the United States does not maintain a permanent diplomatic presence in the country, it's sometimes difficult for U.S. authorities to gather the information they need to thoroughly vet a Syrian applicant.FBI Director James Comey hit on the issue at a congressional hearing last month, when he told lawmakers, \"If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them.\"This particularly comes into play when trying to evaluate an applicant's criminal history.\"In terms of criminal history, we do the best we can with the resources that we have,\" one senior administration official said.Another official emphasized that the vetting process is a holistic one, and they try to take a broader view of an applicant with the available information they're about to aggregate and verify. READ: Ben Carson asks congress to block Syrian refugeesHow many refugees have been admitted to the United States?U.S. government data shows that just under 2,200 Syrian refugees have been admitted into the United States since the civil war broke out in March of 2011, and the vast majority of those were in the last year.The administration has acknowledged that processing resettlement applications is a slow and laborious task, which has kept the United States from accepting as many applicants as it would like to.But the pace of admissions is growing as the United States commits more resources to the endeavor.What do we know about the refugees admitted so far?According to senior administration officials, more than half of the Syrian refugees admitted into the U.S. so far are children.\"Single men of combat age\" represent only 2% of those admitted and the elderly comprise another 2.5%. The male/female breakdown is \"roughly\" 50/50.The approval rate for Syrian refugees so far is a little over 50%, although the official noted that those not included in this pool include both rejected cases and pending cases, so the approval rate is expected to go up.Where are these refugees?The Syrian refugees who have been admitted into the United States so far are spread out over 36 states in 138 cities and towns.California has accepted the most Syrian refugees (252), followed by Texas (242) and Michigan (207).Fourteen states and the District of Columbia have not admitted any refugees, but that doesn't necessarily reflect a lack of will. Resettlement locations are determined based on a number of factors, including family ties, the size of the local immigrant community and the ability of local resettlement agencies to accommodate new cases.Officials also take into account the unemployment rate of the area to ensure refugees are able to find work and begin supporting themselves.READ: Chris Christie on refugees: Not even 5-year-old orphansHow many will be admitted in the future?As the Syrian refugee crisis in Europe and the Middle East became more dire over the summer, the Obama administration decided to re-evaluate how many Syrian refugees could be admitted.Ultimately, the President decided to set a goal of 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which goes until October 2016.In order to accommodate these additional Syrian refugees, the administration upped the total number of refugees it would allow in FY2016 to 85,000, with plans to increase it to 100,000 in FY2017.But there are significant challenges associated with increasing the quota.As noted above, the vetting process for Syrian refugees is intensive and plagued by gaps in information.In order to meet the 10,000 quota it has set, the administration will have to admit five and a half times more Syrian refugees in the coming year than it admitted in the previous 4\u00bd years combined.READ: Ted Cruz: Muslim refugees from Syria should go to other Islamic countriesWho decides the quota?The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 sets fairly clear guidelines for how the government can set and change refugee admissions quotas.Per section 207, the President has the authority to set the annual number, following \"appropriate consultation\" with members of Congress.This is done at the start of the fiscal year but can be revisited midyear in cases where \"an unforeseen emergency refugee situation exists\" and the admission of refugees in response to that emergency \"is justified by grave humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.\"In that situation, the President can amend the number of refugees allowed prior to the start of the next fiscal year, again in consultation with Congress, essentially briefing the lawmakers.READ: Paris attacks become focus of 2016 raceMy governor wants to stop admitting Syria refugees. Is that allowed?Over half of U.S. governors, most of them Republicans, announced in the aftermath of the Paris attacks that their states would not accept any further refugees from Syria. But it's unclear whether they have the legal authority to do this.\"This is a federal program carried out under the authority of federal law,\" one senior administration official noted, \"and refugees arriving in the U.S. are protected by the Constitution and federal law.\"Refugees are required to adjust their status to become legal permanent residents of the United States within one year of their arrival, at which point they are free to move anywhere in the country, although the official noted some specific benefits may only be available in the state where they were originally resettled.But experts tell CNN that while the states may not have the legal authority to block their borders, state agencies have authority to make the process of accepting refugees much more difficult by cutting state and local funding. \"I think the entire program is contingent on the support of the American people,\" the official acknowledged. \"It is contingent, as all programs in the United States government are, on funding from Congress.\"Now lawmakers are weighing in with proposals to block Syrian refugee funding entirely, which would have the effect of freezing their absorption. This step presents its own challenges, since funding for Syrian refugees is allocated along with funds to support refugees from other countries.Follow @CNNpolitics Sign up for CNN Politics' Nightcap newsletter, serving up today's best and tomorrow's essentials in politics.", "article_highlights": "The average processing time for refugee applications is about 12 to 18 months, but Syrian applications can take longer U.S. government data shows that just under 2,200 Syrian refugees have been admitted into the U.S. since the civil war broke out", "article_author": "Laura Koran"}

George W. Bush,\" he said. \"Yes, I mean, so just for the news flash to the world, if they're trying to find places where there's big space between me and my brother, this might not be one of those.\"In the same interview, Bush said he thinks he can sell the Republican base on his position on immigration -- and he's hitting opponents who have changed their positions on the issue.\"I get a sense that a lot of people can be persuaded, to be honest with you,\" the former Florida governor told Megyn Kelly in a preview of his interview that aired Sunday.Bush has urged a respectful tone toward undocumented immigrants and has said it should be easier for those immigrants to gain legal status.That position is anathema to much of the party's conservative base, which opposes \"amnesty\" in any form -- particularly the executive actions President Barack Obama has taken to allow immigrants who were brought into the United States as children to stay, as well as the undocumented parents of U.S. citizen children. Bush said he would repeal Obama's unilateral actions.But the former Florida governor took a shot at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, though not by name, for changing his position on immigration. Walker once supported a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants, but has said he's changed his views -- and even recently called for limits on legal immigration.\"Do you want people to just bend with the wind, to mirror people's sentiment, whoever's in front of you?\" Bush said. \"'Oh yes, I used to be for that, but now I'm for this' -- is that the way we want to elect presidents?\"Bush's perspective differs from much of the GOP field: He lives in Miami, has a Mexican-born wife and has said his family speaks Spanish at home. His brother, former President George W. Bush, previously supported immigration reform efforts.Another Florida Republican presidential candidate, Sen. Marco Rubio, also supported efforts to ease immigrants' ability to attain legal status -- though he's since backed off that position as Republicans have grown increasingly critical of Obama's handling of the issue.As Republicans shift to the right, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has run as far to the left as possible, saying undocumented immigrants should be allowed to become U.S. citizens and that she'd try to go further than Obama in using her executive authority to aid immigrants.Though a politically challenging position for Bush in his likely GOP primary campaign, a moderate immigration position would serve him well in a general election campaign as Hispanic voters are the most rapidly growing voting bloc.Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Eric Bradner, CNN"}

With Mitt Romney having faced constant attacks in 2012 for appearing out of touch -- and now Hillary Clinton battling a similar narrative -- Republicans are stumbling over each other trying to prove who's the most down-to-Earth candidate.That competition was on display this week when the candidates ventured out into New Hampshire for some retail politicking. Chris Christie held a town hall at a dive bar Friday night in Exeter, where voters listened with Solo cups in their hands as the New Jersey governor promised they'd always feel like they knew him.While Jeb Bush was eating blueberry pie Thursday night in Concord, he told a roomful of voters and reporters that when he goes to Chipotle, he drives his \"own car,\" making a not-so-veiled swipe at Clinton.Mike Huckabee let a small throng of reporters and cameras follow him around as he looked at guns and fired off a few rounds in target practice at an indoor gun range in Hudson. When he makes his likely presidential run, he'll preach a message that blue-collar, working class people \"ought to be the heart and soul of the Republican Party,\" he said.And Marco Rubio toured a welding training facility at Manchester Community College, calling to de-stigmatize blue collar jobs.While Walker rocketed to national fame during his battle with public unions during his first term, he's now getting to introduce a less controversial side of himself and develop a narrative that will take root in states like New Hampshire, where voters take seriously their role of getting to know the presidential candidates.After going to church Sunday, Walker told a small gathering of Republicans in Derry, New Hampshire, that he's eager to get his Harley out to the state and ride around. Later, when the booming sound of a motorcycle filtered though the window, he stopped. \"That's the sound of a Harley,\" he said, exciting the audience.Walker's use of Kohl's has not only proven to be a crowd favorite but also an efficient illustration of three messages. First, it helps show he's frugal. He touts his ability to use so many coupons and Kohl's Cash that by the end of the transaction, \"They're basically paying me to buy the shirt.\"Second, it lets him talk tax policy. In the way that Kohl's lowers the prices on items and expands the volume to drive up profits, he'd like to lower the tax rate and expand the number of people who pay taxes, he says. It's already a concept called the \"Laffer Curve,\" but Walker says he's renamed it the \"Kohl's Curve.\"Third, he's found a way to also work in a swipe against Clinton. \"I doubt the presumptive nominee for the other party has ever been to Kohl's,\" he said Saturday night.It's part of a strategy that aims to emphasize that he didn't \"inherent fame and fortune,\" as he frequently says, using a line that also draws a contrast with Bush, whether intentional or not. The Kohl's schtick has also developed a fourth virtue: Giving him a safe and reliable laugh line, even if cheesy at times. As the governor wrapped up his remarks Sunday at the event in Derry, he was presented with a gift bag from the host. \"Is it from Kohl's?\" Walker asked, as the audience roared.19 photos: Potential 2016 presidential candidatesFormer Florida Gov.

And the Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on a case that would affect the right of same-sex couples to marry, likely furthering the political rhetoric on the topic no matter which way the case falls.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, recently shifted her position on the topic, catching her stance up with the majority of her party.\"Hillary Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right,\" said Adrienne Elrod, a Clinton spokeswoman, in a statement last week.As a candidate in 2008, Clinton opposed same-sex marriage, supporting the idea of civil unions instead.

And the U.S. is also eying the establishment of a Special Forces task force in Iraq to boost U.S. efforts to target ISIS and its leaders, the administration official said. President Barack Obama has also authorized enhancing military aid to Jordan and Lebanon to help counter ISIS.America has bombed targets in Syria since September 2014 without stopping ISIS, and it has largely failed in a mission to recruit and train moderate rebels in Syria to take on the terror group. In recent months, the U.S. has also bolstered its aid to local forces, air-dropping weapons, ammunition and other supplies to rebel forces inside Syria. Obama has long resisted an American military presence on the ground to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria but has reluctantly escalated U.S. involvement in that fight over time since launching the military effort in 2014.The number of U.S. military forces in Iraq has swelled to more than 3,500 since Obama first announced the deployment of up to 300 American military advisers to Iraq in June 2014.U.S. Special Ops have previously conducted some secretive missions on the ground in Syria as well. But the deployment marks the first permanent presence of U.S. ground troops in Syria since the U.S. began leading an international effort last year to confront ISIS, the militant Islamist group which now controls broad swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.READ: Syria peace talks, best chance to 'chart a course out of hell,' under wayThe troops are set to be deployed to Syria in the coming days, according to these officials.The decision comes on the heels of the first death of an American military service member in the fight against ISIS. Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler died last week in Iraq as he and other American Special Operations forces conducted a raid to rescue hostages held by ISIS.The troops to be sent to Syria are not expected to serve on the front lines with rebel forces and, according to a U.S. official, they will rotate in and out of Syria from the existing U.S. base in Irbil, Iraq.But they are entering a very hot combat zone and have the right to engage the enemy if they come under fire. They could also join Syrian and Kurdish forces on raids if they get explicit permission from Washington.The Syrian Kurdish fighting force in northern Syria welcomed the decision to deploy U.S. troops to assist them but reiterated the need for more assistance and weaponry to fight ISIS.\"We have experience fighting ISIS and I think the whole world has seen as evidence of that the areas that we currently hold in Syria. We hope that this assistance will evolve from all our different friends and allies. We need all types of assistance but first and foremost weapons are primarily our most important need,\" said Mohamed Rasho, spokesman for the political wing of the YPG, the Syrian Kurd fighting force.JUST WATCHEDTwo years of President Obama on troops in SyriaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTwo years of President Obama on troops in Syria 01:48The stepped-up U.S. military involvement in Syria also comes amid a redoubling of diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution to the multi-year conflict between the Syrian government and rebel forces, which ISIS has exploited to expand its base in the country.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has been holding meetings in recent days with U.S. allies in the region and recently agreed to give Iran a role in the peace talks, which also include Russia, Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.Iran and Russia have supported the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad even as Assad has been accused of committing war crimes against his own people, including the indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas.Russia entered the military fray earlier this month by deploying forces to Syria and launching a bombing campaign that it claims has been targeting ISIS. But the locations of Russian airstrikes have led U.S. military officials to say they believe the Russian effort is aimed more at bolstering Assad's hold on power than fighting ISIS.Russia's military involvement in Syria has been greeted in Washington with a mixture of caution and criticism, with Obama warning Russia earlier this month that its airstrikes in Syria would suck it into a \"quagmire.\"Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told CNN Thursday that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't have a long-term plan for his country's military involvement in Syria, saying he thinks \"he is kind of winging this day to day.\"The U.S. and Russia have in recent weeks held a series of deconfliction talks to find ways to prevent accidents or misunderstandings between U.S. and Russian jets sharing the skies over Syria.READ: After the apocalypse: Inside the Arctic vault that could help keep humanity aliveRussian jets, though, have not been operating in the skies above northern Syria where the U.S. is now deploying ground forces.Obama has faced steady and unrelenting criticism of his leadership in the fight against ISIS, with Republicans and even some Democrats consistently accusing him of lacking any clear strategy to fight the militant Islamist group, which has threatened attacks against the U.S.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican, gave a tempered response Obama's decision to send ground troops to Syria.\"A more serious effort against ISIS in Syria is long overdue,\" he said in a statement Friday. \"Absent a larger coherent strategy, however, these steps may prove to be too little too late. I do not see a strategy for success, rather it seems the Administration is trying to avoid a disaster while the President runs out the clock.\" Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who has also called for a more aggressive approach, said Friday in a statement that it is \"time for the Administration to propose a unified strategy that addresses the intertwined challenges posed by ISIL and President Assad,\" with Friday's decision only addressing \"half the problem -- ISIL, but not Assad.\"Kaine also renewed his calls for Congress to vote on an authorization of the use of military force against ISIS, which it has yet to do. The U.S. has been acting in Syria and Iraq on legal grounds based in the authorization of military force against al Qaeda elements.JUST WATCHEDAmerican leaves U.S. to fight ISISReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAmerican leaves U.S. to fight ISIS 03:12First on CNN: German rapper who joined ISIS killed in U.S. strike, official says2016ers weigh inSen.

Sanders expressed concern about the United States being drawn into the quagmire of the Syrian civil war which could lead to perpetual warfare in that region,\" spokesman Michael Briggs said. \"The senator believes that the crisis in Syria will be solved diplomatically, not militarily.\"Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has staked his presidential campaign on his hawkish foreign policy views, called the decision to deploy Special Operations forces \"an incremental change that will not change the conditions on the ground.\"\"In the eyes of the enemy this is weakness. In the eyes of our allies this is unreliability. ISIL is not going to be intimidated by this move,\" Graham said Friday on MSNBC. \"You know, they're all in for their agenda: the caliphate and their view of the world. President Obama is not all in when it comes to degrading and destroying ISIL and this just reinforces that.\"Graham also renewed his calls for a no-fly zone over Syria to address the refugee problem and to properly train rebel forces.GOP presidential contenders have called for everything from tens of thousands of U.S. troops to be deployed to Iraq to the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria.In an interview with CNN last week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a GOP presidential candidate, called not just for the establishment of a no-fly zone but also a safe zone where moderate rebels \"can organize, train, equip and ultimately present a credible alternative to Assad for the future of Syria.\"Rubio also called for Special Operations forces to be embedded with local forces.\"Only America can convene Sunni forces from what I believe needs to be a combined Sunni force of Egyptians, Saudis, Jordanians, Sunnis in Iraq, Sunnis in Syria to confront a radical Sunni movement and defeat them militarily.They will need our help in convening it,\" Rubio told CNN's Jamie Gangel. \"But it doesn't involve a full-scale U.S. invasion of Iraq.\".m-infographic--1444408445983 { background: url(http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/10/09/isis.tentacle.map.-.9.oct_mobile.long.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; padding-top: 124.47999999999999%; width: 100%; -moz-background-size: cover; -o-background-size: cover; -webkit-background-size: cover; background-size: cover; } @media (min-width: 640px) { .m-infographic--1444408445983{ background-image: url(http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/10/09/isis.tentacle.map.-.9.oct_article.top-expanded..png); padding-top: 57.47692307692308%; } } @media (min-width: 1120px) { .m-infographic--1444408445983{ background-image: url(http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/10/09/isis.tentacle.map.-.9.oct_article.top.wide.png); padding-top: 56.980802792321114%; } }Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "The deployment of U.S. Special Operations forces is the most significant escalation of the Americans military campaign against ISIS to dateObama has long resisted an American military presence on the ground to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria", "article_author": "Barbara Starr and Jeremy Diamond, CNN"}

Christie talked up his direct, truth-telling style, saying it's more appealing to the average voter. But while he's trying to distinguish himself from the former governor, he's not quite ready to start throwing bombs.Bush was asked point blank on Thursday about Bush's previous proposal to re-populate Detroit with immigrants \u2014 a softball question that would have been eaten up by some of the more conservative speakers at CPAC.22 photos: William Temple of the Golden Isles Tea Party in Georgia, dressed as Button Gwinnett, the second signer on the United States Declaration of Independence, cheers as Ben Carson speaks.Hide Caption 1 of 2222 photos: Utah's Mike Lee addresses the conference on Thursday.Hide Caption 2 of 2222 photos: Ben Carson spoke early Thursday morning.Hide Caption 3 of 2222 photos: A woman browses through conservative politicas badges at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.Hide Caption 4 of 2222 photos: A woman works at a stand promoting the oil industry.Hide Caption 5 of 2222 photos: A man displays pins as he attends the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.Hide Caption 6 of 2222 photos: Iowa's Joni Ernst addresses CPAC.Hide Caption 7 of 2222 photos: Volunteers walk by a stand at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference.Hide Caption 8 of 2222 photos: People take part in a 'straw poll' to pick the conservative candidate for the 2016 US presidential election.Hide Caption 9 of 2222 photos: Grover Norquist, founder and president of Americans for Tax Reform, participates in a session on 'Strategic Communication.'Hide Caption 10 of 2222 photos: Carly Fiorina, a potential 2016 contender, waits to be interviewed.Hide Caption 11 of 2222 photos: Chris Christie participates in a discussion at CPACHide Caption 12 of 2222 photos: Texas' Ted Cruz takes the stage.Hide Caption 13 of 2222 photos: Bobby Jindal took the stage on Thursday.Hide Caption 14 of 2222 photos: Scott Walker spoke on Thursday.Hide Caption 15 of 2222 photos: Rand Paul signs books at CPAC.Hide Caption 16 of 2222 photos: Sarah Palin speaks on Thursday at CPAC.Hide Caption 17 of 2222 photos: Former House speaker and GOP presidential hopeful spoke Friday.Hide Caption 18 of 2222 photos: Hide Caption 19 of 2222 photos: Hide Caption 20 of 2222 photos: Hide Caption 21 of 2222 photos: Hide Caption 22 of 22But Christie approached with caution. \"I think that's misdirecting the priorities,\" he said, adding that the concern should be for the \"hardworking people\" already living in Detroit. He was set up again. \"Jeb Bush says they're more entrepreneurial, harder-working and 'more fertile' than Americans,\" Ingraham interrupted.\"Well first of all, I'm not mentioning the fertility thing,\" Christie joked. \"The most entrepreneurial people in the world are the people of the United States and that's why people want to come here.\"The audience applauded. Christie and Bush indeed have taken similar positions on policy. They've both expressed support for Common Core, though Christie now says he has \"grave concerns\" about the federal government's role in the testing standards.They're also tied by a common history: Christie helped raise money for Jeb Bush's brother, George W. Bush, when the then-Texas governor was running for president. President Bush appointed Christie for United States Attorney in New Jersey in 2001.Neither Bush nor Christie are candidates yet, but as the campaign season nears and as Christie continues to struggle to gain traction, he'll face pressure to start drawing sharper contrasts with Bush.So far, Christie's strategy to distinguish himself from the rest of the field has been to embrace the brash, blunt personality that helped make him famous during his first term as governor \u2014 indeed a stark difference to the more reserved style of Bush, who admitted in January that he's an introvert.\"Sometimes people need to be told to sit down and shut up,\" Christie said Thursday, defending his outburst against a protester in the fall.Christie was given another chance to pit himself against Bush.

Christie, who came under heat for saying earlier this year that \"parents need to have some measure of choice\" in vaccinating their children, said he wouldn't support such a proposal and offered an energetic defense of immunizations.\"I think that would be the wrong step for the public health of our country,\" he said. He allowed for what he described \"narrow\" religious exemptions, however. Condon later told reporters she was \"surprised\" and \"disappointed\" by his reaction, saying she thinks it might be a \"politically motivated\" response given the backlash he faced after his comments about vaccinations two months ago. Christie on Cuba: Obama should be 'ashamed of himself'A day after President Obama recommended that Cuba be taken off the list of state sponsors of terrorism, Christie ramped up his rhetoric against the president for making what he called an \"insane\" move. \"It's a national disgrace that the president is engaged in that kind of conduct,\" he said. \"He should be ashamed of himself.\"RELATED: Anatomy of the Chris Christie town hall As he has before, Christie called on Obama to insist that Cuba return convicted cop-killer Joanne Chesimard, who escaped from prison in New Jersey and fled to Cuba where she now lives. \"They're harboring a terrorist murderer who belongs in prison,\" Christie said forcefully, before arguing further against the country's human rights record. \"She's just one example of the atrocities that have happened in Cuba,\" he said. \"Start acting like a normal country. Start acting like a civilized country.\"Christie wants to push aside 'pathway to citizenship'The governor has only recently begun to reveal his views on the immigration debate, and said Wednesday the fight over whether any reform should include a path to citizenship should be tabled for now. Of the immigrants\u2014both legal and undocumented\u2014that he's met, Christie said, none have said they came to the U.S. so they could vote, and dismissed the \"pathway to citizenship\" debate as a narrative fueled by Democrats.\"Most of the folk I've met are much more concerned about work, so let's not get dragged into that part of the conversation,\" he said.And stirring up memories of Mitt Romney circa 2012, Christie volunteered that he's \"not somebody who believes in the concept of self-deportation.\" \"These folks are not going leave on their own,\" he said, describing the idea as a \"fantasy that's just not gonna happen.\" Christie also said deporting undocumented immigrants by force would not be a feasible option, but didn't offer any specific policy solutions. JUST WATCHEDChristie holds New Hampshire town hall ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHChristie holds New Hampshire town hall02:47Christie thinks Donald Trump is 'exhausting'One of the more colorful moments from the town hall came when a man asked Christie what he thinks about Donald Trump. Seeming to appreciate the moment of levity, the governor said Trump's sister was a federal judge in New Jersey and introduced Christie to the real estate titan in 2002. \"He's a great American. He is a quintessential American,\" Christie crooned, adding that he and his wife have gone out to dinner with Trump many times. \"What you see on TV\u2014that's who he is. It's not like he's faking it. That's the whole deal, man. Going to dinner with Donald Trump is exhausting. It's exhausting.\"Christie declined to weigh in on the reality star's political future should Trump actually decide to jump in the presidential race. But he stressed that Trump is a \"showman\" and\"loves to entertain people.\" \"He never, never is anything other than who he is,\" he said. Christie spends a lot of money on college At no point did the governor connect more with the audience than when he disclosed the tuition costs for two of his four children, totaling more than $120,000 next year for his son at Princeton and his daughter at Notre Dame. The governor argued that costs have soared because no \"market forces\" or \"restrictions have been placed upon them.\" \"There's no controls over the cost,\" he said, indicating support for potential regulations.\"We have to start to engage the colleges and universities and say: If you want to participate in these federal programs\u2014loans, grants, some of the rests\u2014you're going to need to agree to controlling some of your costs, because it's obscene.\" Open to boots on the ground in ISIS fightChristie told reporters earlier Wednesday that he's been studying up on foreign policy for the past nine months, and in the town hall he fell in line with many in his party who express support for potential boots in the ground in the fight against ISIS.Key to his strategy, he said, would be strengthening U.S. alliances. To do that, he added, \"we have to be willing to say if need be, we'll also put soldiers in that fight.\"He's also in favor of a \"robust intel community\" and more investment in national defense so \"that no one will want to go to war with us.\" Christie's thoughts on being a 'professional ingrate'Campaign finance reform is a huge issue in New Hampshire, and voters from both sides of the aisle will happily challenge candidates on their positions. One such woman did so Wednesday with Christie, but the governor said he's not opposed to unlimited campaign contributions\u2014as long as they're disclosed within 24 hours.\"There shouldn't be any restrictions on who can give how much to who, but there needs to be 24-hour, absolute giving-out of that information over the Internet for people to know who you're taking from,\" he said. In his remarks, Christie bemoaned the concept of fundraising, saying he hates doing it as much as anyone. \"It's one of the most difficult, distasteful parts of the job, and I'd rather be spending much more time out there than doing this,\" he said.The woman pushed back, arguing that even when big donors are revealed, they still have an influence on the candidates. But Christie said candidates at times need to brush off the wishes of their financial backers.\"To be an effective politician, you need to be a professional ingrate,\" he said. \"You have to be willing to take people's money and not do everything they want.\"Christie on why people pay taxesDefending part of his entitlement reform proposal\u2014in which he recommends that anyone making at least $200,000 a year during retirement shouldn't receive Social Security payments\u2014Christie hit back at criticism that people won't be getting money from a system they paid into for decades. \"You pay taxes for lots of things that you don't get something directly back for. You do it to try and make us a better country and a better society,\" Christie said, making an argument that may not play well with staunch anti-tax advocates. The governor, who said he'll lay out his tax reform plan in the coming weeks, said there are two ways that Americans have \"always stood up\" to help the less fortunate.\"We do it through private philanthropy, and we do it through giving money to government and having government do good works. Sometimes government does it well. Sometimes they do it poorly,\" he said. \"But in this instance, I think we need to make sure those programs are there.\" 21 photos: Chris Christie's career in photosNew Jersey Gov.

She also slammed Obama over his comments right before the attack that ISIS had been \"contained.\"\"I am angry. I am angry that just yesterday morning, our president, against all evidence, declared ISIS contained and took a victory lap,\" the former Hewlett-Packard CEO said. \"ISIS is not a 'JV team,' Mr. President, they are not contained, they are at our shores and they measure their victory in body count.\"Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told the gathering in Florida he \"wouldn't invite the refugees in the first place.\"Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal sent a letter to Obama \"demanding\" information about the refugees, including how they will be monitored and screened for terror ties.\"Last week, the city of New Orleans began receiving its first wave of Syrian refugees,\" Jindal said in the letter. \"As with former immigration crises and federal relocation policy, Louisiana has been kept in the dark about those seeking refuge in the state. It is irresponsible and severely disconcerting to place individuals, who may have ties to ISIS, in a state without the state's knowledge or involvement.\"Several candidates urged Obama to reconsider the move just hours after the Paris attack on Friday. 13 photos: Increased security following Paris attacks13 photos: Increased security following Paris attacksPeople go through a security checkpoint to attend a Mass in homage to victims of the Paris terror attacks at Notre Dame cathedral in Paris on Sunday, November 15.

I see the world as it really is, and it's time for a president who sees the world as it really is, not how he wishes it would be,\" Christie said.Ohio Gov.

U.S. counterterrorism officials worried the latter would be the second phase the ISIS fight.While ISIS was gaining and solidifying control of territory, external attacks weren't its priority. But the concern among counterterror officials was that once the U.S. and others began attacking to curb the territorial expansion, or even causing some retreat, ISIS would start sending back its legions of westerners or try to infiltrate fighters to conduct attacks. U.S. counterterrorism officials expected that Europe, particularly countries with big foreign-fighter numbers, would be first to feel this.World leaders to conveneThe battle against ISIS was already slated to occupy large portions of the agenda of the large meeting of global leaders in Turkey that Obama is set to attend. White House officials, speaking before the Paris attack, said Obama was eager to shore up the global coalition of nations that have joined to battle the group.Now those discussions will assume an even greater urgency. Obama was originally planning to speak with French President Francois Hollande at the G20 gathering, but Hollande said Friday he was canceling his trip to Turkey.That leaves other key players, including Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister David Cameron, to develop a response plan at the summit, being held at a resort on the Turkish Riviera. Leaders were already scheduled to meet for a working dinner focused on combating ISIS on Sunday, and Obama will meet with the leaders five major European allies Monday afternoon. Obama will also encounter Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose recent efforts in Syria forced the administration to retool its strategy. While no formal meeting between the two men is planned, Obama's aides said there's ample opportunity for a talk. Opinion: The real enemy we are facingEarlier efforts to combat extremismThe January attack by Islamic extremists against the French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo prompted a reckoning in Europe about the flow of foreign fighters onto the continent, and the pervasive appeal of Islamic extremism on disillusioned youth. At least one of the Charlie Hebdo attackers pledged allegiance to ISIS online, though none were known to be operating under direct orders from the group's leadership. 40 photos: World reacts to Paris attacks40 photos: World reacts to Paris attacksPresident Barack Obama, French President Francois Hollande, second from right, and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo arrive at the Bataclan, site of one of the Paris terrorists attacks, to pay their respects to the victims after Obama arrived in town for the COP21 climate change conference early on Monday, November 30, in Paris.

I think we all recognize that this is a particular problem that has roots in Muslim communities,\" Obama told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in a January interview. \"But I think we do ourselves a disservice in this fight if we are not taking into account the fact that the overwhelming majority of Muslims reject this ideology.\"Is ISIS moving into the realm of international terrorism?Earlier in the year, Obama chaired a session of the United Nations Security Council meant to address the flow of foreign fighters coming from Syria, following up on the meeting during this year's general assembly by saying he wanted to focus on the origins of extremism.But even with those efforts in place, Obama's aides admit there's no quick solution to the pervasive problems facing Europe and the United States.\"It is not about a single meeting or a single event,\" Obama's National Security Adviser Susan Rice said ahead of the President's trip to the G20. \"These issues are hugely complex and fraught.

And the Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on a case that would affect the right of same-sex couples to marry, likely furthering the political rhetoric on the topic no matter which way the case falls.Hillary Clinton, the Democratic frontrunner, recently shifted her position on the topic, catching her stance up with the majority of her party.\"Hillary Clinton supports marriage equality and hopes the Supreme Court will come down on the side of same-sex couples being guaranteed that constitutional right,\" said Adrienne Elrod, a Clinton spokeswoman, in a statement last week.As a candidate in 2008, Clinton opposed same-sex marriage, supporting the idea of civil unions instead.

I think you are trying to say that I used to be opposed and now I am in favor and I did it for political reason and that is just flat wrong.\"Clinton's argued that for the four years she served as secretary of state, she was \"out of domestic politics\" and not in a position to back same-sex marriage.

Martin O'Malley sought to highlight his longstanding support for same-sex marriage in a tweet that included a video with a veiled swipe at Clinton's change of heart.\"The dignity of every person tells us that the right to marry is not a state right, it is a human right,\" O'Malley tweeted.

Difficult but constructive: we have enough common ground to start UN led political process,\" she tweeted. Kerry outlined six of the major points of agreement in a press conference following the talks: that Syria's state institutions will remain intact; that the rights of all Syrians, regardless of ethnicity or religious denomination, must be protected; that it is imperative to accelerate all diplomatic efforts to end the war; that humanitarian access must be assured throughout the territory of Syria, and the participants will increase support for internally displaced persons, refugees and their host countries; and that ISIS and other terror groups be designated by the UN Security Council, and agreed by the participants must be defeated.Friday's talks come as news broke that the U.S. is set to deploy U.S. troops on the ground in Syria for the first time to advise and assist rebel forces combating ISIS, multiple officials said.RELATED: U.S. to send Special Forces to SyriaThey also come after news that at least 40 people were killed and 100 were wounded in rockets attack near Damascus earlier in the day, the Syrian Observatory for human Rights said in statement.The group said the Syrian government forces have launched rockets attack targeting a marketplace in town of Duma in Damascus suburbs. The group also said that the number of casualties is likely to increase as some of the wounded are in critical condition.Still, Kerry said Thursday that even if the talks on Syria's future didn't reach an immediate political solution, they represented the best hope forward after the bloody civil war that has killed more than 250,000. \"What that transitional government could look like, who would be part of it, how they would meet and at what frequency -- all of this is up in the air,\" one senior State Department official said, noting that Kerry is just seeking agreement on the framework. JUST WATCHEDAnalyst: Iran joins talks to set terms in its favorReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHAnalyst: Iran joins talks to set terms in its favor 03:50Some 18 nations, plus the European Union, were invited to the meeting. They include Russia and, for the first time, Iran.With so many competing agendas at the table, one diplomat described Kerry's role as a \"maestro\" trying to bring the dueling positions closer to the middle.But with everyone singing from different sheet of music, U.S. officials and diplomats signaled even firm agreement Friday on the broad strokes appeared slim.\"The Saudis, Turks and Qataris are pushing hard in one direction, the Russians and Iranians are pushing in another. Some are in the middle,\" one Arab diplomat said.\"How do you balance those set of demands?\" he asked. \"Everyone is agreed we need a way out though a negotiated settlement. But once you get into the nitty-gritty, the time frames and the specifics, it all falls apart.\"The main sticking point among the major powers remains the future of Assad. The U.S. and its European and Arab allies want to see Assad hand over power fairly quickly, while Russia wants to organize a political process by which the transitional government can then decide on Assad's future first, after which Syrians can decide his future.Friday's talks come weeks after Russia began a bombing campaign to put pressure on opponents of Assad. While the U.S. and Arab countries had once called on Assad to leave power as the first step to a transition, they have tempered that call as the war has dragged on and as Russia comes to Assad's assistance. Meanwhile Iran, which agreed to join the talks for the first time, is the one country at the table that still has not signed onto the idea of a transition from Assad.\"The Saudis won't sign on unless there is a guarantee that at end the end of this period, say it's 12 months, that Assad is gone,\" one Arab diplomat said. \"So far the Russians have not said they are willing to commit to that, and the Iranians haven't agreed to him going at all.\"Administration officials have expressed cautious optimism that Russia will support Assad's eventual transition from power, even if he is allowed to remain for a period of time. The time frame for his departure has ranged from six to 18 months. 51 photos: Syria's civil war in pictures51 photos: Syria's civil war in picturesPro-government protesters hold pictures of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his late father, Hafez al-Assad, during a rally in Damascus, Syria, on March 18, 2011.

But it marked the first time the Syrian government and representatives of the armed opposition sat at the negotiating table. This time, the plan being discussed appears to have little role for the Syrians themselves. There seems to be a disconnect between the major power brokers meeting in Vienna and the demands of the Syrians, who were not invited to the meeting. But U.S. officials said a key aspect of the conversation will be a renewed effort to better organize Syria's fragmented opposition.Michael Ratney, the U.S. coordinator for Syria, flew this past weekend to Turkey to meet with both the political opposition and rebel leaders to fill them in on the ongoing diplomacy.\"They are not ready,\" one senior U.S. official said. \"They are not capable of sitting down at this table because they do not even agree with themselves.\" After five years of the U.S. failing to organize the political opposition, Joshua Landis of the University of Oklahoma said Kerry is in the unenviable position of letting Russia run a political process that won't ultimately get rid of Assad. \"Americans keep clinging the notion of regime change on the cheap and Russia keeps clinging to the notion they can retake the country,\" Landis said.Landis said that Russia has an incentive to continue the talks so Saudi Arabia does not make good on threats to increase its support for jihadis in Syria to fight against Russian forces. \"When the (Syrian) regime and Russia talk about a political solution, they are talking about using their military force in order to kill or force the jihadists out and create an environment where the more moderate militias have to come in from the cold and make a deal with the regime,\" according to Landis. \"You can sugarcoat it by saying there will be elections, but elections over the past 50 years have all turned out the same way. Assad isn't going anywhere. \"But U.S. officials and European diplomats stress that both Russia and Iran have an incentive to de-escalate the conflict. \"Iran has put billions of dollars into this conflict that isn't going anywhere and Russian intervention came in an effort to stop the regime from falling,\" one European diplomat.\"Clearly the Assad question is the big issue,\" the diplomat continued. \"But the fact everyone is able to sit at the same table is significant, and we need to test if we can find any common ground.

Christie criticized the proposed agreement reached earlier this month to limit Iran's nuclear program, and warned that a nuclear Iran could inspire other countries in the Middle East to push for nuclear weapons of their own. In the face of pushback from the White House, Congress has been lobbying for months to have a greater say in the deal with Iran. The two entities reached a compromise earlier this week, and the White House indicated Tuesday it would support legislation that would let Congress have some input into the deal. \"I'm glad Congress is going to get involved in reviewing any deal the president makes. We need to have some more sober heads other than the president's looking at this,\" Christie said. \"And I don't think it's a good deal for America the way it's framed right now.\"Christie has largely been quiet on specific foreign policy issues, saying instead that he's focused on governing his state and that he'll start weighing in once he becomes an official candidate. He said Wednesday that he's been studying up for the past eight or nine months to become better familiar with the issues at stake. \"I'm not one of these guys who's going to give, on something as serious and important as foreign policy, a seat-of-the-pants answer,\" he told reporters Wednesday. \"When I have an informed opinion, I'll give it, and when I don't ... I say 'I don't know.' I think 'I don't know' is a pretty powerful answer in politics.\"In New Hampshire on Tuesday, Christie warned of doom for entitlement programs and laid out his policy push for reform, which would include ending Social Security payments to the very wealthy among other proposals. Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Christie was asked if he'd consider tax increases to help address fiscal issues on the federal level. \"Everything's on the table for conversation, but I don't think that the problem right now in America is that we're undertaxed,\" he said. \"So that would not be my inclination.\"Raising taxes, he said, would not be enough to fix entitlement programs, saying they must first be reformed. But he didn't take tax hikes off the table. \"When you're a leader you have to be willing to listen to everybody's ideas,\" he said. \"But my ideas I've laid out very specifically yesterday how to fix these problems -- it doesn't include increasing taxes.

And I think, for me, I'm also someone who likes to delegate responsibility to people and let them perform.\"He told reporters Tuesday that the U.S. attorney's investigation does not factor into his timeline for announcing his 2016 decision, which he reiterated will come in the late spring or early summer. READ: Anatomy of the Chris Christie town hallSince the controversy, Christie has struggled to regain his once sky-high favorability ratings at home, and he's worked to rehabilitate his national image. At the diner Wednesday, a voter joked to Christie that when he heard the governor was coming to New Hampshire, he \"made sure personally that the bridges were going to stay open.\"Laughing it off, Christie asked, \"which direction is the bridge? I'll go and make sure.\"Another voter sitting at the same table said he was caught in the traffic jam on the bridge caused by the closures in September 2013. \"It was my anniversary,\" he said. \"Really? How did it go? Not well, huh?\" Christie asked.\"Not well,\" he said, as the table laughed.The man, Richard Moquin, later told Politico that he misremembered the incident, and it was in December, not September, of 2013 that he and his wife were stuck in traffic on their anniversary. The governor is scheduled to hold a town hall in Londonderry later on Wednesday, followed by a second town hall in the state on Friday.

And it was uncharacteristic for Christie, a political bruiser who regularly shouts down critics and, just a few months ago, defied the White House by forcibly quarantining a nurse who treated Ebola patients.WATCH: Obama: Vaccinate your kidsThe flap is a reminder that as a politician who made his name by telling it like it is, Christie will be carefully watched for any sign he is toning down his act or hedging on difficult issues as he tries to navigate the early skirmishes of a likely presidential campaign.With Democrats pouncing on a new chance to brand Christie as \"anti-science\" and reporters jumping on a story that livened up a routine trade mission, the Christie camp rushed out an unusual clarification.\"To be clear: the Governor believes vaccines are an important public health protection and with a disease like measles there is no question kids should be vaccinated,\" said Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts. \"At the same time different states require different degrees of vaccination, which is why he was calling for balance in which ones government should mandate.\"JUST WATCHEDGov. Chris Christie's London tourReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHGov. Chris Christie's London tour 02:02The episode hit the headlines because federal health officials are expressing alarm that a spate of measles cases is being fueled by skepticism among some parents of infant vaccination schedules.The United States is one of the most vaccinated nations in the world. Experts note that infants face more than 20 shots before they are 18 months old and some parents question the speed and utility of all the doses.READ: Hillary Clinton hits GOP with pro-vaccine tweetClaims picked up by the so-called anti-vaxxer movement, now debunked by scientific research, argue that shots can cause childhood autism and other unintended side effects.So it's not surprising that politicians should face questions about the issue --especially if they are a governor who is thinking of running for president.Christie seems to have been tripped up more by policy than substance. When he spoke with nuance, it came across as a political calculation because his careful remarks contrasted with his own tendency to talk most of the time in an unmistakeably blunt way.READ: Measles outbreak: How bad can it be?\"Get the hell off the beach ... and get out, you're done,\" Christie, for instance, once told people he saw on news footage who had yet to take Hurricane Irene's approach seriously in 2011.So his equivocation on Monday raised questions over his motives. Was Christie for instance fudging on an issue that could play into suspicions of government mandates - in health care, education and other areas -- that could animate the 2016 Republican primary race?There is, after all, precedent for a vaccination flap having political reverberations in a primary race. Then-Texas Gov. Rick Perry came under fire in 2012 from Republican opponents who opposed his executive order requiring girls to be vaccinated against human papillomavirus, which spreads through sexual transmission.JUST WATCHEDShould parents be liable for unvaccinated children?ReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHShould parents be liable for unvaccinated children? 05:11Social conservatives opposed making the shot mandatory for girls as young as 11.Another candidate, Michele Bachmann, helped torpedo her own campaign by suggesting the drug could cause \"mental retardation.\"Christie is not the only candidate being forced to weigh in on the vaccinations debate which looks set to rumble through the 2016 campaign.Republican Sen. Rand Paul, a physician, said he thought vaccinations were a good thing but parents should have some input in how they are used. He told CNBC he had staggered a program of doses for his children when they were newborns. And he added that he had heard of \"many tragic cases of walking, talking, normal children who wound up with profound mental disorders after vaccines.\"Another potential Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina was quoted by Buzzfeed.com as saying that \"vaccinating for measles makes a lot of sense.\" But she added: \"I do think parents have to make those choices.\"Christie's struggles in getting his own message across may have several explanations, not all political. He could simply have been caught off guard in a place far from the early skirmishes of the Republican presidential sweepstakes.Or perhaps he was off his game, when appearing before a small traveling press pack, after battling a five-hour time difference to stay up late to watch the Super Bowl.But the episode is a reminder of the perils facing a politician who prizes speaking off the cuff. \"Is he going to have to be clarifying his comments all the time?\" said Jonathan Jaffe, a communications consultant who publishes a daily newsletter on New Jersey politics.MAP: The measles outbreak\"Christie is a very casual speaker. He talks a lot of the time off the top of his head,\" Jaffe said, saying that quality could become a liability when every word is parsed by political journalists or opponents.Indeed, candidates like Christie who build a brand on straight talk, often face extra scrutiny when they appear to hedge on an argument.\"It depends on what the vaccine is, what the disease type is and all the rest,\" Christie said, trying to explain his initial quote. \"I didn't say I'm leaving people the option. What I'm saying is that you have to have that balance in considering parental concerns.\"He went on: \"Not every vaccine is created equal and not every disease type is as great a public health threat as others. So that's what I mean by that so that I'm not misunderstood.\"Christie's remarks, for once, were not as direct as those of the more professorial President Barack Obama, who touched on the issue in a pre-Super Bowl interview with NBC.\"There is every reason to get vaccinated but there aren't reasons to not,\" said Obama, adding \"the science is pretty indisputable.\"Taken out of their political context, Christie's remarks seem a lot less contentious.Mark Largent, a Michigan State University professor who wrote a book about the vaccination debate in modern America, said that issues like inoculation schedules tend to be seen as a barometer for candidates on wider issues of scientific and medical issues.He says the debate is a rare one which cuts across political divides. On the right, objectors tend to sense the overweening hand of big government and infringments on individual liberties.On the left, suspicion is driven by skepticism about the motives of the pharmaceutrical industry, he said.The result is a debate in which legitimate concerns can be drowned out by politics.Christie \"is very moderate in what he is saying, but he is going to get pummeled as anti-vaccine,\" Largent said.Christie's comments may also be conditioned by his time in New Jersey where there has been a spirited debate over the issue, with activists complaining about what they say are the nation's most expansive mandates for child vaccines.The Daily Beast reported on Monday that as far back as his first gubernatorial campaign in 2009, Christie expressed sympathy for parents of autistic children who wanted more input over which vaccines were administered to kids. The speed with which Christie's camp rushed to put out Monday's storm appeared to signal that the governor was not making some sort of clever play for government-hating activists on the conservative right -- a sector of the Republican Party where he must make inroads.But Democrats wouldn't give him a break, giving him a dose of his own tough talk.\"Chris Christie isn't a scientist. He isn't a doctor. And he sure as heck isn't a leader,\" said Democratic National Committee spokesman Mo Elleithee.", "article_highlights": "Measles flap stamps on Christie message in UKSparks new Democratic claims GOP is 'anti-science'Politics overwhelms substance in medical debate", "article_author": "Stephen Collinson, CNN"}

But they were so atypical for a Republican candidate gearing up for a presidential run that the universal reaction from conservative operatives was \"Wow.\"That's the word Hogan Gidley, a South Carolina Republican operative who's advised both Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum's presidential campaigns, used when confronted with the comments.RELATED: Bush: Parents 'ought to' vaccinate kids\"Those are definitely not helpful for Mr. Bush,\" he said. Gidley did note, however, that immigration reform hasn't been a deal-breaker in the South Carolina primary in the past, pointing to Newt Gingrich's 2012 primary win as evidence, and that Bush will \"have so much money that he can, possibly, overcome these types of things.\"\"But,\" he added, \"it's going to take a lot of money to overcome some of these types of quotes.\"\"Wow\" is also what conservative strategist Daniel Horowitz, who edits the site ConservativeReview.com, said when he saw them.\"I'm just reading this stuff \u2014 wow,\" he said. \"This is insane. Honestly, I don't take him seriously, because of [comments like] these and because of the Bush name it's very hard to see him getting anywhere in a primary.\"And it was the response to the comments from Brent Bozell, chairman of the conservative group ForAmerica.\"That thinking is utterly contrary to what grassroots Republicans believe. He is reflecting the viewpoint of the Chamber of Commerce and big business,\" he said.Conservative lawmakers declined to outright take aim at Bush, but they showed surprise at his comments.\"Well, I don't think [he] would\" suggest an accelerated pathway to citizenship for DREAMers, said Rep. Raul Labrador, when asked about the hypothetical case of a potential GOP presidential candidate proposing such a thing.\"You look at what Jeb Bush has said...and it's well within the mainstream of the Republican Party,\" he added.Confronted with Bush's comments, Labrador demurred, saying he hadn't seen the interview so he couldn't comment.Immigration hardliner Rep. Steve King, too, avoided knocking Bush, but suggested his comment on immigration \"repopulating\" Detroit was out of touch.\"I would probably have sat on the mountaintop a long time before I would have thought of that,\" he said with a chuckle.The comments add to one of Bush's greatest challenges in the GOP primary \u2014 a record that, while once conservative for the party, hasn't aged well as the GOP has moved farther right. Bozell warned that, once the gloves are off, Bush's comments will haunt him through the primary.\"Watch for his opponents to smack him in the mouth all primary season long with his own words,\" he said.And his record and rhetoric on immigration reform in particular are likely to cause him trouble in the key early states of Iowa and South Carolina, where the social-conservative GOP base is strong and immigration is a hot-button issue.Texas-based GOP operative Matt Mackowiak suggested this offers conservatives who are already skeptical of the former Florida governor more reason to be wary.\"It kind of pours gasoline on the fire among conservatives who don't trust Jeb on immigration,\" he said.Mackowiak noted that Bush hadn't done anything to try to move farther to the right on immigration, or explain his previous comments.\"They're either convinced that they can't change the way people view him, or, as he said, he needs to persuade Republicans on this,\" he said.He said \"we'll see\" whether that happens, and suggested Iowa would be a good test of whether Bush is successful at convincing the party to get on board.RELATED: Jeb Bush heads to Iowa next monthBut if Bush does attempt to move farther right, he risks being labeled at best a flip-flopper and at worst a panderer, and offers fodder for Democratic attacks.Indeed, Jesse Lehrich, spokesman for American Bridge, accused Bush of \"flagrant pandering\" to a friendly audience, while veering to the right under different circumstances.\"It turns out that if you put Jeb Bush in the right room, he talks like Ted Kennedy. Put him somewhere else and he's the 'head-banging conservative' he once declared himself,\" he said.\"Maybe he doesn't realize how much has changed in the 13 years since he last ran for public office, but these days, the cameras are always rolling \u2014 and flagrant pandering isn't a good look.\"Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "", "article_author": "Alexandra Jaffe, CNN"}

The latest such meeting will happen Wednesday \u2014 this time in New Hampshire, where Christie will test the water ahead of a presidential announcement that could come later this year.A former U.S. attorney, Christie has grown so comfortable with the town hall style that he's taking it on the road. He'll hold two town halls as part of what's been dubbed the \"Tell It Like It Is\" series when he makes a four-day swing through New Hampshire this week ahead of his likely presidential bid.Taking unscripted questions from audiences is both an art and a skill and Christie is a master. The forums highlight his blunt, direct style helped put him in the national spotlight during his first term. When Christie tangles with folks in New Jersey, it can bring negative attention, but it's a disposition he's embracing as he seeks to distinguish himself from other White House contenders.\"We've always known that the governor is his own best communicator,\" said Kevin Roberts, a spokesman for Christie. \"Whenever possible we try to put him in his own words and let him do his own talking.At Christie's events, audience members are screened by state police before entering, but they're not screened for political ideology. In an ear when many politicians and campaigns select their audiences, a Christie town hall is different. Anyone who hears about the town hall is allowed to show up.Neil Levesque, executive director of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College, said town halls are popular because people like getting the chance to ask follow-up questions.\"It's almost like you're jumping into a pool and you're subjecting yourself to the voters,\" he said. \"I think voters love the fact that they can come and really press candidates.\" A new approach to hecklersWhile most of the hour long Q&A consists of questions about local issues, fireworks emerge when people \"break\" the so-called rules.Hecklers make regular appearances at Christie's town halls. At the event in Kenilworth, a small group of demonstrators stood up in the Q&A portion to loudly protest the governor's handling of a recent environmental settlement with Exxon. \"Arrest Christie!\" they shouted as they were escorted out by police.Christie hasn't shied away from taking on protesters in the past, but he has offered more restraint recently. In Kenilworth, he simply waited for the young protesters to leave, then called on the next person to ask a question. It was a high school English teacher who grilled the governor on the same Exxon deal and pension reform.JUST WATCHEDThe \"Inside Politics\" forecastReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHThe \"Inside Politics\" forecast 03:41The two spent the next 10 minutes sparring over how Christie could have demanded more money in the settlement, among other issues.\"I'm not here to be bullied,\" she declared.\"You're not being bullied,\" he shot back. \"You're asking me questions. I get to ask you questions back.\"Two other people were escorted out in that same town hall: A protester and a man who yelled out questions at the end.Ann Marie Duda, 62, said she was pleased with how Christie handled some of the more colorful moments from the day.\"He's been known to be a bit abusive and rough, but I thought he conducted himself very well,\" she said.She found the experience -- her first Christie town hall--\"informational,\" even though she didn't get to ask the governor her question. \"We all love New Jersey, we're all from New Jersey, everything here is about New Jersey,\" she said, with a laugh. \"While we were waiting, why was 'New York, New York' playing?\"Like clockwork It's true. Moments before Christie was set to walk out, Sinatra's \"New York, New York\"started to play. The warm-up soundtrack was heavy on New Jersey artists. Christie is famous in his devotion to the music of Bruce Springsteen, but it is actually Bon Jovi -- \"Have a Nice Day\" -- that he prefers to open a town hall.As usual, a stool with two waters bottles sat waiting for the governor in the circle where he'd be speaking, a space his staff calls \"the round.\" Also in the round was a black music stand with a small timer.Christie has held town halls in all 21 of New Jersey's counties, and the venue varies each time. While the set-up looks simple enough \u2014 a bunch of chairs arranged in a circular format \u2014 Christie's advance team arrives a day ahead of schedule to start turning whatever gym, civic center, church or meeting hall where they're gathering into a recognizable Christie town hall space. JUST WATCHEDInside the Palm Beach political money circuitReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHInside the Palm Beach political money circuit 02:01His office brings in two camera crews that are positioned with the press in two opposing corners of the room, making it easier to capture Christie's movements as he walks around in a full circle. More recently, his team has been live-streaming the full event.A local official typically introduces Christie. The governor stands quietly behind the curtain for a brief moment to gather his thoughts before he walks out to applause and kicks off a monologue that usually runs close to half an hour.At the town hall in Kenilworth, Christie explained why he's willing to reform New Jersey's pension system and blamed the state's fiscal woes on the Democratic legislature for refusing to lower taxes.\"I say to people, listen, if you're not a millionaire, but you want to feel like one,\" he says, \"come to New Jersey.\"Mastering the craftWhen Christie first started doing the town halls, he addressed the audience from the front of a room. But his aides soon decided that he should be positioned among the audience in a less formal, in-the-round format.They also stopped asking people to line up to ask questions, favoring instead a process by which the governor calls on someone already sitting with their hand raised. That, his aides suggest, creates a more intimate feel.As Christie prepares to take the town hall on the trail, he told CNN he'll keep the format largely the same--except for maybe the \"four rules.\"\"It's not New Jersey, so we can probably take one or two of them off,\" he joked. \"It depends on how people behave themselves.\"19 photos: Potential 2016 presidential candidatesFormer Florida Gov.

And the U.S. is also eying the establishment of a Special Forces task force in Iraq to boost U.S. efforts to target ISIS and its leaders, the administration official said. President Barack Obama has also authorized enhancing military aid to Jordan and Lebanon to help counter ISIS.America has bombed targets in Syria since September 2014 without stopping ISIS, and it has largely failed in a mission to recruit and train moderate rebels in Syria to take on the terror group. In recent months, the U.S. has also bolstered its aid to local forces, air-dropping weapons, ammunition and other supplies to rebel forces inside Syria. Obama has long resisted an American military presence on the ground to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria but has reluctantly escalated U.S. involvement in that fight over time since launching the military effort in 2014.The number of U.S. military forces in Iraq has swelled to more than 3,500 since Obama first announced the deployment of up to 300 American military advisers to Iraq in June 2014.U.S. Special Ops have previously conducted some secretive missions on the ground in Syria as well. But the deployment marks the first permanent presence of U.S. ground troops in Syria since the U.S. began leading an international effort last year to confront ISIS, the militant Islamist group which now controls broad swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.READ: Syria peace talks, best chance to 'chart a course out of hell,' under wayThe troops are set to be deployed to Syria in the coming days, according to these officials.The decision comes on the heels of the first death of an American military service member in the fight against ISIS. Master Sgt. Joshua Wheeler died last week in Iraq as he and other American Special Operations forces conducted a raid to rescue hostages held by ISIS.The troops to be sent to Syria are not expected to serve on the front lines with rebel forces and, according to a U.S. official, they will rotate in and out of Syria from the existing U.S. base in Irbil, Iraq.But they are entering a very hot combat zone and have the right to engage the enemy if they come under fire. They could also join Syrian and Kurdish forces on raids if they get explicit permission from Washington.The Syrian Kurdish fighting force in northern Syria welcomed the decision to deploy U.S. troops to assist them but reiterated the need for more assistance and weaponry to fight ISIS.\"We have experience fighting ISIS and I think the whole world has seen as evidence of that the areas that we currently hold in Syria. We hope that this assistance will evolve from all our different friends and allies. We need all types of assistance but first and foremost weapons are primarily our most important need,\" said Mohamed Rasho, spokesman for the political wing of the YPG, the Syrian Kurd fighting force.JUST WATCHEDTwo years of President Obama on troops in SyriaReplayMore Videos ...MUST WATCHTwo years of President Obama on troops in Syria 01:48The stepped-up U.S. military involvement in Syria also comes amid a redoubling of diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution to the multi-year conflict between the Syrian government and rebel forces, which ISIS has exploited to expand its base in the country.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has been holding meetings in recent days with U.S. allies in the region and recently agreed to give Iran a role in the peace talks, which also include Russia, Turkey, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia.Iran and Russia have supported the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad even as Assad has been accused of committing war crimes against his own people, including the indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas.Russia entered the military fray earlier this month by deploying forces to Syria and launching a bombing campaign that it claims has been targeting ISIS. But the locations of Russian airstrikes have led U.S. military officials to say they believe the Russian effort is aimed more at bolstering Assad's hold on power than fighting ISIS.Russia's military involvement in Syria has been greeted in Washington with a mixture of caution and criticism, with Obama warning Russia earlier this month that its airstrikes in Syria would suck it into a \"quagmire.\"Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told CNN Thursday that he believed Russian President Vladimir Putin didn't have a long-term plan for his country's military involvement in Syria, saying he thinks \"he is kind of winging this day to day.\"The U.S. and Russia have in recent weeks held a series of deconfliction talks to find ways to prevent accidents or misunderstandings between U.S. and Russian jets sharing the skies over Syria.READ: After the apocalypse: Inside the Arctic vault that could help keep humanity aliveRussian jets, though, have not been operating in the skies above northern Syria where the U.S. is now deploying ground forces.Obama has faced steady and unrelenting criticism of his leadership in the fight against ISIS, with Republicans and even some Democrats consistently accusing him of lacking any clear strategy to fight the militant Islamist group, which has threatened attacks against the U.S.House Armed Services Committee Chairman Mac Thornberry, a Texas Republican, gave a tempered response Obama's decision to send ground troops to Syria.\"A more serious effort against ISIS in Syria is long overdue,\" he said in a statement Friday. \"Absent a larger coherent strategy, however, these steps may prove to be too little too late. I do not see a strategy for success, rather it seems the Administration is trying to avoid a disaster while the President runs out the clock.\" Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, who has also called for a more aggressive approach, said Friday in a statement that it is \"time for the Administration to propose a unified strategy that addresses the intertwined challenges posed by ISIL and President Assad,\" with Friday's decision only addressing \"half the problem -- ISIL, but not Assad.\"Kaine also renewed his calls for Congress to vote on an authorization of the use of military force against ISIS, which it has yet to do.

Sanders expressed concern about the United States being drawn into the quagmire of the Syrian civil war which could lead to perpetual warfare in that region,\" spokesman Michael Briggs said. \"The senator believes that the crisis in Syria will be solved diplomatically, not militarily.\"Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who has staked his presidential campaign on his hawkish foreign policy views, called the decision to deploy Special Operations forces \"an incremental change that will not change the conditions on the ground.\"\"In the eyes of the enemy this is weakness. In the eyes of our allies this is unreliability. ISIL is not going to be intimidated by this move,\" Graham said Friday on MSNBC. \"You know, they're all in for their agenda: the caliphate and their view of the world. President Obama is not all in when it comes to degrading and destroying ISIL and this just reinforces that.\"Graham also renewed his calls for a no-fly zone over Syria to address the refugee problem and to properly train rebel forces.GOP presidential contenders have called for everything from tens of thousands of U.S. troops to be deployed to Iraq to the establishment of a no-fly zone over Syria.In an interview with CNN last week, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a GOP presidential candidate, called not just for the establishment of a no-fly zone but also a safe zone where moderate rebels \"can organize, train, equip and ultimately present a credible alternative to Assad for the future of Syria.\"Rubio also called for Special Operations forces to be embedded with local forces.\"Only America can convene Sunni forces from what I believe needs to be a combined Sunni force of Egyptians, Saudis, Jordanians, Sunnis in Iraq, Sunnis in Syria to confront a radical Sunni movement and defeat them militarily.They will need our help in convening it,\" Rubio told CNN's Jamie Gangel. \"But it doesn't involve a full-scale U.S. invasion of Iraq.\".m-infographic--1444408445983 { background: url(http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/10/09/isis.tentacle.map.-.9.oct_mobile.long.png) no-repeat 0 0 transparent; padding-top: 124.47999999999999%; width: 100%; -moz-background-size: cover; -o-background-size: cover; -webkit-background-size: cover; background-size: cover; } @media (min-width: 640px) { .m-infographic--1444408445983{ background-image: url(http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/10/09/isis.tentacle.map.-.9.oct_article.top-expanded..png); padding-top: 57.47692307692308%; } } @media (min-width: 1120px) { .m-infographic--1444408445983{ background-image: url(http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2015/images/10/09/isis.tentacle.map.-.9.oct_article.top.wide.png); padding-top: 56.980802792321114%; } }Follow @CNNpolitics", "article_highlights": "The deployment of U.S. Special Operations forces is the most significant escalation of the Americans military campaign against ISIS to dateObama has long resisted an American military presence on the ground to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria", "article_author": "Barbara Starr and Jeremy Diamond, CNN"}

There are historic numbers of women in Congress, and the idea of \"leaning in\" is a catch phrase among professional women. Meanwhile, the feminism label doesn't seem as charged as it once was -- people from Beyonce to actor Joseph Gordon-Levitt are identifying as feminist.\"As far as the political culture and culture in general, this is as good a time as any for a women to run for the highest office. There is a willingness now to promote pro-women messages,\" said Jennifer Lawless, who runs the Women & Politics Institute at American University.\"People are ready for a woman president.The question is this: Are they ready for Hillary as that woman?\"According to a recent Pew poll, nearly three quarters of Americans expect to see a woman president in their lifetime. But that hope splits along partisan -- not gender -- lines. Only 20% of Republican women hope to see a woman president and nearly 70% of Democratic women do. INTERACTIVE: Hillary Clinton tries againIn the run-up to her announcement and at women-centered events, Clinton sometimes strode on stage to the song \"I'm Every Woman,\" and recalled how she juggled work and motherhood as a young lawyer. She has acknowledged a double standard for women and advised women to be tough.She has also frequently mentioned her granddaughter, Charlotte, as the reason she wants to remain in public life, a theme that will no doubt be heard on the campaign trail as she kicks off a tour in Iowa this week with small events. She made pushing for the expansion of the rights of women and girls part of her diplomatic work as secretary of state, as detailed in her book \"Hard Choices.\" Her new campaign website is plastered with pictures of women, with Clinton, in a blue cloth coat, holding a cup of coffee listening intently to another woman as a man looks on.The emphasis on women -- and the progress of women -- as a possible underlying campaign theme is a reversal of her 2008 strategy, which stressed experience and competence over history. But the problem with that approach was that avoiding the obvious wasn't possible and didn't make for good politics. Gender card\"She is the gender card.She doesn't need to play it because she embodies it. She is the woman candidate. She has shared women's experiences. Being a mom and a grandmother,\" said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake.\"She will just naturally bring it in. If she overplayed it, which she won't, it could backfire.\"Republicans certainly hope the gender play backfires and that voters are fatigued by the kind of identity politics that have defined the Obama years.The Wayne LaPierre, the National Rifle Association's president, put it this way at the group's recent annual meeting: \"Eight years of one demographically symbolic president is enough.\"Speaking on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, Tennessee Rep. Marsha Blackburn acknowledged that many women would like to see a female president in their lifetime but said she didn't think it would be Clinton.\"There's a couple of things there. Trust, honesty -- those get in her way,\" Blackburn said. \"As we talk about the polling that is out there, that gets in Hillary's way and she's not authentic.\"READ: Breaking down the Clinton campaign launchIn 2014, Democratic candidates such as former Colorado Sen. Mark Udall proved that the \"war on women\" style of campaigning that worked so well in 2012 had reached its limits. Udall lost that race and picked up the nickname \"Mark Uterus\" along the way for his incessant focus on women's issues.And Democrats found that in states such as Texas, Kentucky and Georgia, white married women and white working class women tended to prefer Republicans.Katie Packer Gage, who has been talking to women in focus groups about Clinton's run, said that to many women, the \"idea of Hillary is more popular than the reality.\"'A typical politician'\"She starts out having some benefits of gender because she is something different, but then starts to feel like a typical politician and gets back down to earth,\" said Packer Gage, who runs Burning Glass Consulting, a firm that coaches Republicans on appealing to women voters. \"You do see her starting to frame her campaign as a campaign for women, but that's a narrow campaign, not a winning campaign.You aren't going to win 100% of women.\"Among Republicans, former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina might mount a challenge to Clinton and try to neutralize some of the former first lady's strengths as the lone woman in a field dominated by men.Fiorina released a Facebook video Sunday in which she said Clinton was a \"highly intelligent woman\" but doesn't have a track record of accomplishment or trustworthiness. \"She's not the woman for the White House,\" Fiorina said.READ: Hillary Clinton says \"I'm running\"And among Democrats, former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could jump in and be the champion for the white working man, a demographic that he has said is left out of the Democrat's increasingly diverse tent. Kentucky GOP Sen. Rand Paul, who launched his presidential campaign last week, has noted that the Clinton Foundation took money from foreign countries who oppress women, suggesting that the pro-woman framing won't be an easy sell.But Clinton will have some high-profile champions.Moments after her announcement, top Democrats rolled out endorsements, including Barbara Mikulski, the first Democratic woman elected to the Senate in her own right. READ: GOP rivals take aim at Clinton\"Whoopee, Hillary is off and running,\" she wrote in a statement. \"I'm ready for Hillary. And America is ready for Hillary. She is going to break that glass ceiling once and for all.\" At a recent EMILY's List event before announcing her run, Clinton asked her supporters: \"Don't you someday want to see a woman president?\"In that particular crowd the answering was a resounding yes.But it's unlikely that the same question will make it in her campaign speeches. After all, the answer across the country is much more complicated.50 photos: Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlightFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, pictured here on Tuesday, March 3, has become one of the most powerful people in Washington.
